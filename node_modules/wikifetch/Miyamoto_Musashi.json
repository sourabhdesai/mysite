Shinmen Takezō, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his [[Art-name]], Niten Dōraku,[1] was a Japanese [[Swordsman]] and [[R%C5%8Dnin]]. Musashi, as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his excellent swordsmanship in numerous duels, even from a very young age. He was the founder of the [[Hy%C5%8Dh%C5%8D_Niten_Ichi-ry%C5%AB]] or Niten-ryū style of swordsmanship and the author of [[The_Book_of_Five_Rings]] (五輪の書, Go Rin No Sho[[Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets]]), a book on strategy, tactics, and philosophy that is still studied today. Miyamoto Musashi is widely considered a [[Kensei]] and one of the greatest warriors of all time.","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Musashi_ts_pic.jpg/220px-Musashi_ts_pic.jpg"]},"[edit] Birth":{"text":"The details of Miyamoto Musashi's early life are difficult to verify. Musashi himself simply states in Gorin no Sho that he was born in [[Harima_Province]].[2] Niten Ki (an early biography of Musashi) supports the theory that Musashi was born in 1584: \"[He] was born in [[Harima_Province]], in Tenshō 12 [1584], the Year of the Monkey.\"[3] The historian Kamiko Tadashi, commenting on Musashi's text, notes: \"[...]Munisai was Musashi's father...he lived in Miyamoto village, in the Yoshino district [of [[Mimasaka_Province]]]. Musashi was most probably born here.\"[4] His childhood name was Bennosuke 弁之助.Musashi gives his full name and title in Gorin no Sho as Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara no Genshin.\" (新免武蔵守藤原玄信)[5] His father, [[Shinmen_Munisai]] 新免無二斎, was an accomplished martial artist and master of the sword and [[Jutte]] (also jitte).[6] Munisai, in turn, was the son of Hirata Shōgen 平田将監, a vassal of Shinmen Iga no Kami, the lord of [[Takayama_Castle]] in the Yoshino district of Mimasaka Province.[7] Hirata was relied upon by Lord Shinmen, and so was allowed to use the Shinmen name. As for \"Musashi,\" Musashi no Kami was a court title, making him the nominal governor of Musashi province. \"[[Fujiwara_clan]]\" was the lineage from which Musashi claimed nominal descent.","images":[]},"[edit] Munisai and Musashi's birth date":{"text":"Mysteriously, Munisai's tomb says he died in 1580, which obviously conflicts with the accepted birth date of 1584 for Musashi. Further muddying the waters, according to the genealogy of the extant Miyamoto family, Musashi was born in 1582. [[Kenji_Tokitsu]] has suggested that the accepted birth date of 1584 for Musashi is wrong, as it is primarily based on a literal reading of the introduction to the Go Rin No Sho where Musashi states that the years of his life \"add up to 60\" (yielding the twelfth year of the Tensho era, or 1584, when working backwards from the well-documented date of composition), when it should be taken in a more literary and imprecise sense, indicating not a specific age but merely that Musashi was in his sixties when he wrote it.Because of the uncertainty centering on Munisai (when he died, whether he was truly Musashi's father, etc.), Musashi's mother is known with even less confidence. Here are a few possibilities:","images":[]},"[edit] Upbringing":{"text":"Regardless of the truth about Musashi's ancestry, when Musashi was seven years old, the boy was raised by his uncle, [[Dorinbo]] (or Dorin), in Shoreian temple, three kilometers (~1.8 mi.) from Hirafuku. Both Dorin and Musashi's uncle by marriage — Tasumi — educated him in [[Buddhism]] and basic skills such as writing and reading. This education is possibly the basis for [[Yoshikawa_Eiji]]'s fictional education of Musashi by the historical [[Zen]] monk [[Takuan_S%C5%8Dh%C5%8D]]. He was apparently trained by Munisai in the sword, and in the family art of the [[Jutte]]. This training did not last for a very long time, as in 1589, Munisai was ordered by [[Shinmen_Sokan]] to kill Munisai's student, Honiden Gekinosuke. The Honiden family was displeased, and so Munisai was forced to move four kilometers (~2.5 mi.) away to the village of Kawakami.In 1592, Munisai died, although Tokitsu believes that the person who died at this time was really Hirata Takehito.Musashi contracted [[Eczema]] in his infancy, and this adversely affected his appearance.[9] Another story claims that he never took a bath because he did not want to be surprised unarmed. While the former claim may or may not have some basis in reality, the latter seems improbable.[10] An unwashed member of the warrior caste would not have been received as a guest by such houses as [[Honda_Tadakatsu]], [[Ogasawara_clan]] and [[Hosokawa_clan]]. These and many other details are likely embellishments that were added to his legend, or misinterpretations of literature describing him.His father's fate is uncertain, but it is thought that he died at the hands of one of Musashi's later adversaries, who was punished or even killed for treating Musashi's father badly. However, there are no exact details of Musashi's life, since Musashi's only writings are those related to strategy and technique.","images":[]},"[edit] Training in swordsmanship":{"text":"The name \"Musashi\" was thought to be taken from the name of a warrior monk named [[Saito_Musashibo_Benkei]] who served under [[Minamoto_no_Yoshitsune]], but this is unconfirmed.It is said that he may have studied at the [[Yoshioka-ry%C5%AB]] [[Dojo]] (school), which was also said to be a school Musashi defeated single-handedly during his later years, although this is very uncertain. He did have formal training either by his father until he was 7 years old or from his uncle beginning at the age of 7. Ultimately the name was taken from his own original kanji, 武蔵, which can be read as Takezō or as Musashi, as stated in Eiji Yoshikawa's book [[Musashi_(novel)]].","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Miyamoto_Musashi_Painting.jpg/220px-Miyamoto_Musashi_Painting.jpg"]},"[edit] First duel":{"text":"According to the introduction of [[The_Book_of_Five_Rings]], Musashi states that his first successful duel was at the age of thirteen, against a samurai named Arima Kihei who fought using the [[Kashima_Shint%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB]] style, founded by [[Tsukahara_Bokuden]] (b. 1489, d. 1571). The main source of the duel is the Hyoho senshi denki (\"Anecdotes about the Deceased Master\"). Summarized, its account goes as follows:","images":[]},"[edit] Travels and duels":{"text":"In 1599, three years later, Musashi left his village, apparently at the age of 15 (according to the Tosakushi, \"The Registry of the Sakushu Region\", although the Tanji Hokin Hikki says he was 16 years old in 1599, which agrees time-wise with the age reported in Musashi's first duel).[8] His family possessions such as furniture, weapons, genealogy, and other records were left with his sister and her husband, Hirao Yoemon.He spent his time [[Musha_shugy%C5%8D]], such as with an adept called Akiyama from the [[Tajima_Province]].In 1600, a war began between the [[Toyotomi_clan]] and [[Tokugawa_clan]] clans. Musashi apparently fought on the side of the Toyotomi's \"Army of the West\", as the [[Shinmen_clan]] (to whom his family owed allegiance) had allied with them. Specifically, he participated in the attempt to take Fushimi castle by assault in July 1600, in the defense of the besieged [[Gifu_Castle]] in August of the same year, and finally in the [[Battle_of_Sekigahara]]. Some doubt has been cast on this final battle, as the Hyoho senshi denki has Musashi saying he is \"no lord's vassal\" and refusing to fight with his father (in Lord Ukita's battalion) in the battle. Omitting the Battle of Sekigahara from the list of Musashi's battles would seem to contradict the Go Rin No Sho's statement that Musashi fought in six battles, however. Regardless, as the Toyotomi side lost, it has been suggested that Musashi fled as well and spent some time training on [[Mount_Hiko]].After the battle, Musashi disappears from the records for a while. The next mention of him has him arriving in [[Kyoto]] at the age of 20 (or 21), where he began a series of duels against the Yoshioka School. Musashi's father, Munisai, also fought against a master of the Yoshioka school and won 2 out of 3 bouts in front of the [[Shogun]] at the time, [[Ashikaga_Yoshiaki]] who granted him the title of \"Unrivaled Under The Sun\". The Yoshioka School (descended from either the [[Tenshin_Sh%C5%8Dden_Katori_Shint%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB]] or the Kyo-hachi-ryū) was the foremost of the eight major schools of martial arts in Kyoto, the \"Kyo-ryū\" / \"Schools of Kyoto\". Legend has it that these eight schools were founded by eight monks taught by a legendary martial artist resident on the sacred [[Mount_Kurama]]. At some point, the Yoshioka family also began to make a name for itself not merely in the art of the sword but also in the textile business and for a dye unique to them. They gave up teaching swordsmanship in 1614 when they fought in the Army of the West against [[Tokugawa_Ieyasu]] in the [[Siege_of_Osaka]], which they lost. But in 1604, when Musashi began duelling them, they were still preeminent. There are various accounts of the duels — the Yoshioka family documents claim that there was only one, against Yoshioka Kenpō, which Musashi won.Musashi challenged Yoshioka Seijūrō, master of the Yoshioka School, to a duel. Seijūrō accepted, and they agreed to a duel outside Rendaiji in Rakuhoku, in the northern part of Kyoto on 8 March 1604. Musashi arrived late, greatly irritating Seijūrō. They faced off, and Musashi struck a single blow, per their agreement. This blow struck Seijūrō on the left shoulder, knocking him out, and crippling his left arm. He apparently passed on the headship of the school to his equally accomplished brother, Yoshioka Denshichirō, who promptly challenged Musashi for revenge. The duel took place in Kyoto outside a temple, [[Sanj%C5%ABsangen-d%C5%8D]]. Denshichirō wielded a staff reinforced with steel rings (or possibly with a ball-and-chain attached), while Musashi arrived late a second time. Musashi disarmed Denshichirō and defeated him. This second victory outraged the Yoshioka family, whose head was now the 12-year old Yoshioka Matashichiro. They assembled a force of archers, musketeers and swordsmen, and challenged Musashi to a duel outside Kyoto, near [[Ichij%C5%8D-ji]] Temple. Musashi broke his previous habit of arriving late, and came to the temple hours early. Hidden, Musashi assaulted the force, killing Matashichiro, and escaping while being attacked by dozens of his victim's supporters. To escape and fight off his opponents he was forced to draw his second sword and defend himself with a sword in each hand. This was the beginning of his niten'ichi sword style. With the death of Matashichiro, this branch of the Yoshioka School was destroyed.After Musashi left Kyoto, some sources recount that he travelled to Hōzōin in [[Nara_Prefecture]], to duel with and learn from the monks there, widely known as experts with lance weapons. There he settled down at Enkoji Temple in [[Harima_Province]], where he taught the head monk's (one Tada Hanzaburo's) brother. Hanzaburo's grandson would found the Ensu-ryū based on the Enmei-ryū teachings and [[Iaido]].From 1605 to 1612, he travelled extensively all over Japan in [[Musha_shugy%C5%8D]], a warrior pilgrimage during which he honed his skills with duels. He was said to have used [[Bokken]] in actual duels. Most of the engagements from these times did not try to take the opponent's life unless both agreed, but in most duels, it is known that Musashi did not care which weapon his foe used — such was his mastery.A document dated 5 September 1607, purporting to be a transmission by Miyamoto Munisai of his teachings, suggests Munisai lived at least to this date. In this year, Musashi departed Nara for [[Edo]], during which he fought (and killed) a [[Kusarigama]] practitioner named [[Shishido_Baiken]]. In Edo, Musashi defeated [[Mus%C5%8D_Gonnosuke]], who would found an influential staff-wielding school known as [[Shint%C5%8D_Mus%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB]]. Records of this first duel can be found in both the Shinto Muso-ryu tradition and the [[Hy%C5%8Dh%C5%8D_Niten_Ichi-ry%C5%AB]] (Miyamoto Musashi's school). The Shinto Muso Ryu tradition states that, after being defeated by Musashi, Muso Gonnusuke beat Musashi in a rematch. There are no current reliable sources outside the Shinto Muso Ryu tradition to confirm that this second duel took place.Musashi is said to have fought over 60 duels and was never defeated, although this is a conservative estimate, most likely not accounting for deaths by his hand in major battles. In 1611, Musashi began practicing [[Zazen]] at the [[My%C5%8Dshin-ji]] temple, where he met [[Nagaoka_Sado]], vassal to [[Hosokawa_Tadaoki]]; Tadaoki was a powerful lord who had received the [[Kumamoto_Domain]] in west-central [[Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB]] after the Battle of Sekigahara. Munisai had moved to northern Kyūshū and became Tadaoki's teacher, leading to the possibility that Munisai introduced the two. Nagaoka proposed a duel with a certain adept named [[Sasaki_Kojir%C5%8D]]. Tokitsu believes that the duel was politically motivated, a matter of consolidating Tadaoki's control over his fief.On April 13, 1612, Musashi (about age 30) fought his duel with [[Sasaki_Kojir%C5%8D]], who was known as \"The Demon of the Western Provinces\" and who wielded a [[Nodachi]]. Musashi came late and unkempt to the appointed place — the island of [[Funajima]], in the [[Kanmon_Straits]] separating [[Honsh%C5%AB]] and [[Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB]]. The duel was short. Musashi killed his opponent with a [[Bokken]] that legend says he had carved from an oar used on the boat that carried him to the island. Musashi's late arrival is controversial. Sasaki's outraged supporters thought it was dishonorable and disrespectful, while Musashi's supporters thought it was a fair way to unnerve his opponent. Another theory is that Musashi timed the hour of his arrival to match the turning of the tide. The tide carried him to the island. After his victory, Musashi immediately jumped back in his boat and his flight from Sasaki's vengeful allies was helped by the turning of the tide. Another theory states he waited for the sun to get in the right position. After he dodged a blow, Sasaki was blinded by the sun.Musashi briefly established a fencing school that same year.In 1614–1615, Musashi participated in the war between the Toyotomi and the Tokugawa. The war had broken out because [[Tokugawa_Ieyasu]] saw the Toyotomi family as a threat to his rule of Japan; most scholars believe that, as in the previous war, Musashi fought on the Toyotomi side. [[Osaka_Castle]] was the central place of battle. The first battle (the Winter Battle of Osaka; Musashi's fourth battle) ended in a truce. The second (the Summer Battle of Osaka; Musashi's fifth battle) resulted in the total defeat of Toyotomi Hideyori's Army of the West by Ieyasu's Army of the East in May 1615. Some reports go so far as to say that Musashi entered a duel with Ieyasu, but was recruited after Ieyasu sensed his defeat was at hand. This may seem unlikely since Ieyasu was in his 70s and was in poor health already, but it remains unknown how Musashi came into Ieyasu's good graces.Other accounts claim he actually served on the Tokugawa side, but such a claim is unproven, although Musashi had a close relationship with some Tokugawa vassals through his duel with Sasaki Kojirō, and in the succeeding years, he did not drop out of sight as might be expected if he were being persecuted for being on the losing side. In his later years, Ogasawara and Hosokawa supported Musashi greatly — an atypical course of action for these Tokugawa loyalists, if Musashi had indeed fought on behalf of the Toyotomi.In 1615 he entered the service of Ogasawara Tadanao (小笠原忠直) of [[Harima_Province]], at Ogasawara's invitation, as a \"Construction Supervisor,\" after previously gaining skills in craft. He helped construct [[Akashi_Castle]] and in 1621 to lay out the organization of the town of [[Himeji,_Hy%C5%8Dgo]]. He also taught martial arts during his stay, specializing in instruction in the art of [[Shuriken]]-throwing. During this period of service, he adopted a son.In 1621, Musashi defeated Miyake Gunbei and three other adepts of the Togun-ryu in front of the lord of Himeji; it was after this victory that he helped plan Himeji. Around this time, Musashi developed a number of disciples for his Enmei-ryū although he had developed the school considerably earlier; at the age of 22, Musashi had already written a scroll of Enmei-ryū teachings called \"Writings on the Sword Technique of the Enmei-ryū\" (Enmei-ryū [[Kenpo]] sho). 円/\"En\" meant \"circle\" or \"perfection\"; 明/\"mei\" meant \"light\"/\"clarity\", and 流/\"ryū\" meant \"school\"; the name seems to have been derived from the idea of holding the two swords up in the light so as to form a circle. The school's central idea is given as training to use the twin swords of the samurai as effectively as a pair of sword and [[Jutte]].In 1622, Musashi's adoptive son, [[Miyamoto_Mikinosuke]], became a [[Vassal]] to the [[Himeji_Domain]]. Possibly this prompted Musashi to leave, embarking on a new series of travels, winding up in Edo in 1623, where he became friends with the [[Confucian]] scholar [[Hayashi_Razan]], who was one of the Shogun's advisors. Musashi applied to become a swordmaster to the [[Shogun]], but as he already had two swordmasters (Ono Jiroemon Tadaaki and [[Yagy%C5%AB_Munenori]] — the latter also a political advisor, in addition to his position as the head of the Shogunate's secret police), Musashi's application was denied. He left Edo in the direction of [[Mutsu_Province]], ending up in [[Yamagata_Prefecture]], where he adopted a second son, Miyamoto Iori. The two then traveled, eventually stopping in [[Osaka]].In 1626, Miyamoto Mikinosuke, following the custom of [[Junshi]], committed [[Seppuku]] because of the death of his lord. In this year, Miyamoto Iori entered Lord Ogasawara's service. Musashi's attempt to become a vassal to the lord of [[Owari_Domain]], like other such attempts, failed.In 1627, Musashi began to travel again. In 1634 he settled in [[Kokura]] with Iori, and later entered the service of the [[Daimyo]] [[Ogasawara_Tadazane]], taking a major role in the [[Shimabara_Rebellion]]. Iori served with distinction in putting down the rebellion and gradually rose to the rank of [[Kar%C5%8D]] — a position equal to a [[Minister_(government)]]. Musashi, however was reputedly injured by a thrown rock while scouting in the front line, and was thus unnoticed.","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/IchijojiSagarimatsuKyoto.jpg/220px-IchijojiSagarimatsuKyoto.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Stele_Musashi.jpg/225px-Stele_Musashi.jpg"]},"[edit] Later life and death":{"text":"Six years later, in 1633, Musashi began staying with [[Hosokawa_Tadatoshi]], daimyo of [[Kumamoto_Castle]], who had moved to the Kumamoto fief and Kokura, to train and paint. Ironically, it was at this time that the Hosokawa lords were also the patrons of Musashi's chief rival, Sasaki Kojirō.[[[Wikipedia:Please_clarify]]] While there he engaged in very few duels; one would occur in 1634 at the arrangement of Lord Ogasawara, in which Musashi defeated a lance specialist by the name of Takada Matabei. Musashi would officially become the retainer of the Hosokowa lords of Kumamoto in 1640. The Niten Ki records \"[he] received from Lord Tadatoshi: 17 retainers, a stipend of 300 [[Koku]], the rank of ōkumigashira 大組頭, and [[Chiba_Castle]] in Kumamoto as his residence.\"[12]In the second month of 1641, Musashi wrote a work called the Hyoho Sanju Go (\"Thirty-five Instructions on Strategy\") for Hosokawa Tadatoshi; this work overlapped and formed the basis for the later Go Rin No Sho. This was the year that his third son, Hirao Yoemon, became Master of Arms for the Owari fief. In 1642, Musashi suffered attacks of [[Neuralgia]], foreshadowing his future ill-health. In 1643 he retired to a cave named [[Reigand%C5%8D]] as a hermit to write The Book of Five Rings. He finished it in the second month of 1645. On the twelfth of the fifth month, sensing his impending death, Musashi bequeathed his worldly possessions, after giving his manuscript copy of the Go Rin No Sho to the younger brother of Terao Magonojo, his closest disciple. He died in Reigandō cave around June 13, 1645 ([[Sh%C5%8Dh%C5%8D]] 3, 30th day of the 4th month). The Hyoho senshi denki described his passing:Musashi died of what is believed to be [[Lung_cancer]][[[Wikipedia:Citation_needed]]], and was not killed in combat. He died peacefully after finishing the [[Dokk%C5%8Dd%C5%8D]] (\"The Way of Walking Alone\", or \"The Way of Self-Reliance\"), 21 precepts on self-discipline to guide future generations.His body was interred in armor within the village of Yuge, near the main road near Mount Iwato, facing the direction the Hosokawas would travel to Edo; his hair was buried on Mount Iwato itself.Nine years later, a major source about his life — a monument with a funereal eulogy to Musashi — was erected in Kokura by Miyamoto Iori; this monument was called the Kokura hibun. An account of Musashi's life, the Niten-ki 二天記, was published in Kumamoto in 1776, by Toyota Kagehide, based on the recollections of his grandfather Toyota Masataka, who was a second generation pupil of Musashi.","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/P03jigazou.jpg/220px-P03jigazou.jpg","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Musashizuka_park.JPG/220px-Musashizuka_park.JPG","http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/Musashi_on_the_back_of_a_whale.jpg/220px-Musashi_on_the_back_of_a_whale.jpg"]},"[edit] Teachings":{"text":"Musashi created and perfected a two-sword [[Kenjutsu]] technique called niten'ichi (二天一, \"two heavens as one\") or nitōichi (二刀一, \"two swords as one\") or \"Ni-Ten Ichi Ryu\" (A Kongen Buddhist Sutra refers to the two heavens as the two guardians of [[Gautama_Buddha]]). In this technique, the swordsman uses both a large sword, and a \"companion sword\" at the same time, such as a [[Katana]] with a [[Wakizashi]]. Although he had mastership in this style of two swords, he most commonly used a katana in duels.The two-handed movements of temple drummers may have inspired him, although it could be that the technique was forged through Musashi's combat experience. [[Jutte]] techniques were taught to him by his father — the jutte was often used in battle paired with a sword; the jutte would parry and neutralize the weapon of the enemy while the sword struck or the practitioner grappled with the enemy. In his time a long sword in the left hand was referred to as gyaku nito. Today Musashi's style of swordsmanship is known as Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū.[[[Wikipedia:Citation_needed]]]Musashi was also an expert in throwing weapons. He frequently threw his short sword, and [[Kenji_Tokitsu]] believes that shuriken methods for the wakizashi were the Niten Ichi Ryu's secret techniques [13].Musashi spent many years studying Buddhism and swordsmanship. He was an accomplished artist, sculptor, and calligrapher. Records also show that he had architectural skills. Also, he seems to have had a rather straightforward approach to combat, with no additional frills or aesthetic considerations. This was probably due to his real-life combat experience; although in his later life, Musashi followed the more artistic side of [[Bushid%C5%8D]]. He made various [[Zen]] brush paintings, [[Calligraphy]], and sculpted wood and metal. Even in The Book of Five Rings he emphasizes that samurai should understand other professions as well. It should be understood that Musashi's writings were very ambiguous, and translating them into English makes them even more so; that is why so many different translations of the Go Rin No Sho can be found. To gain further insight into Musashi's principles and personality, one could read his other works, such as Dokkodo and Hyoho Shiji ni Kajo.","images":[]},"[edit] Timeline":{"text":"The following timeline follows, in chronological order (of which is based on the most accurate and most widely accepted information), the life of Miyamoto Musashi as of yet.[[[Wikipedia:Citation_needed]]]","images":[]},"[edit] Philosophy":{"text":"Throughout Musashi's last book, The Book of Five Rings (五輪書, Go Rin no Sho[[Help:Installing_Japanese_character_sets]]), Musashi seems to take a very philosophical approach to looking at the \"craft of war\"; \"There are five ways in which men pass through life: as gentlemen, warriors, farmers, artisans and merchants.\" These falling into one of the few profession groups that could be observed in Musashi's time.Throughout the book, Musashi implies that the way of the Warrior, as well as the meaning of a \"True strategist\" is that of somebody who has made mastery of many art forms away from that of the sword, such as tea drinking ([[Japanese_tea_ceremony]]), laboring, writing, and painting as Musashi practiced throughout his life. Musashi was hailed as an extraordinary [[Sumi-e]] artist in the use of ink monochrome as depicted in two such paintings: \"Shrike Perched in a Dead Tree\" (Koboku Meigekizu, 枯木鳴鵙図) and \"Wild Geese Among Reeds\" (Rozanzu, 魯山図). Going back to the Book of Five Rings, Musashi talks deeply about the ways of Buddhism.He makes particular note of artisans and [[Construction_foreman]]. In the time in which he writes the book, the majority of houses in Japan were made of wood. In the use of building a house, foremen have to employ strategy based upon the skill and ability of their workers.In comparison to warriors and soldiers, Musashi notes the ways in which the artisans thrive through events; the ruin of houses, the splendor of houses, the style of the house, the tradition and name or origins of a house. These too, are similar to the events which are seen to have warriors and soldiers thrive; the rise and fall of prefectures, countries and other such events are what make uses for warriors, as well as the literal comparisons of the: \"The carpenter uses a master plan of the building, and the way of strategy is similar in that there is a plan of campaign\".","images":[]},"[edit] Way of strategy":{"text":"Throughout the book, Go Rin No Sho, the idea which Musashi pushes is that the \"way of the strategist\" (Heihō 兵法) is similar to how a carpenter and his tools are mutually inclusive, e.g. — a carpenter can do nothing without his tools, and vice versa. This too, he compares to skill, and tactical ability in the field of battle.Initially, Musashi notes that throughout China and Japan, there are many \"sword fencers\" who walk around claiming they are strategists, but are, in fact, not — this may be because Musashi had defeated some such strategists, such as [[Arima_Kihei]].The idea is that by reading his writings, one can become a true strategist from ability and tactical skill that Musashi had learned in his lifetime. He argues that strategy and virtue are something which can be earned by knowing the ways of life, the professions that are around, to perhaps learn the skills and knowledge of people and the skills of their particular professions.However, Musashi seems to state that the value of strategy seems to be homogeneous. He notes that:As well as noting that strategy is destined to die;As a form, strategy was said to be one of \"Ten Abilities and Seven Arts\" that a warrior should have, but Musashi disagrees that one person can gain strategy by being confined to one particular style, which seems particularly fitting as he admits \"I practice many arts and abilities — all things with no teacher\" — this perhaps being one of the reasons he was so highly regarded a swordsman.Musashi's metaphor for strategy is that of the bulb and the flower, similar to [[Western_culture]] philosophy of \"[[The_chicken_or_the_egg]]\", the \"bulb\" being the student, the \"flower\" being the technique. He also notes that most places seem to be mostly concerned with their technique and its beauty. Musashi writes, \"In this kind of way of strategy, both those teaching and those learning the way are concerned with coloring and showing off their technique, trying to hasten the bloom of the flower\" (as opposed to the actual harmony between strategy and skill.)With those who are concerned with becoming masters of strategy, Musashi points out that as a carpenter becomes better with his tools and is able to craft things with more expert measure, so too can a warrior, or strategist become more skilled in his technique. However, just as a carpenter needs to be able to use his tools according to plans, so too must a strategist be able to adapt his style or technique to the required strategy of the battle he is currently engaged in.This description also draws parallels between the weapons of a trooper (or soldier) and the tools of a carpenter; the idea of \"the right tool for the right job\" seems to be implied a lot throughout the book Go Rin No Sho. Musashi also puts into motion the idea that when a carpenter is skilled enough in aspects of his job, and creates them with expert measure, then he can become a foreman.Although it is not expressly mentioned, it may be seen that Musashi indicated that when you have learned the areas in which your craft requires, be it carpentry, farming, fine art or battle, and are able to apply them to any given situation, then you will be experienced enough to show others the wisdom of your ways, be it as a foreman of craftsmen, or as a general of an army.From further reading into the book, the idea of \"weapons within strategy,\" as well as Musashi referring to the power of the writer, may seem that the strategy which Musashi refers to does not exclusively reside within the domain of weaponry and duels, but within the realm of war and battles with many men:Within the book, Musashi mentions that the use of two swords within strategy is mutually beneficial between those who utilize this skill. The idea of using two hands for a sword is an idea which Musashi disagrees with, in that there is not fluidity in movement when using two hands — \"If you hold a sword with both hands, it is difficult to wield it freely to left and right, so my method is to carry the sword in one hand\"; he as well disagrees with the idea of using a sword with two hands on a horse, and/or riding on unstable terrain, such as muddy swamps, rice fields, or within crowds of people.In order to learn the strategy of Ni-Ten Ichi Ryu, Musashi employs that by training with two long swords, one in each hand, you will be able to overcome the cumbersome nature of using a sword in both hands. Although difficult, Musashi agrees that there are times in which the long sword must be used with two hands, but if your skill is good enough, you should not need it. The idea of using two long swords is that you are starting with something to which you are unaccustomed, and that you will find difficult, but will adapt to after much use.After using two long swords proficiently enough, Musashi then states that your mastery of a long sword, and a \"companion sword\", most likely a wakizashi, will be much increased — \"When you become used to wielding the long sword, you will gain the power of the Way and wield the sword well.\".In short, it could be seen that from the excerpts from Go Rin No Sho, the real strategy behind Ni-Ten No Ichi Ryu, is that there is no real iron-clad method, path, or type of weaponry that is specific to the style of Ni-Ten No Ichi Ryu:The strategy of the long sword is different than other strategies, in that it is much more straightforward. In the strategy of the longsword, it seems that Musashi's ideal was, that by mastering gripping the sword, it could become a platform used for moving onto the mastery of Ni-Ten Ichi Ryu, as well as being able to use two broadswords, or more masterfully use a companion sword.Musashi often use the term \"two fingers\" to describe the way to hold the long sword. But this does not mean he actually taught the grip with only two fingers. In \"The Water Book\" he notes:However, just because the grip is to be light, it does not mean that the attack or slash from the sword will be weak. As with any other technique in the Ni-Ten Ichi Ryu, he notes:As with most disciplines in martial arts, Musashi notes that the movement of the sword after the cut is made must not be superfluous; instead of quickly returning to a stance or position, one should allow the sword to come to the end of its path from the force used. In this manner, the technique will become freely flowing, as opposed to abrupt.Musashi also discouraged the use of only one sword for fighting, and the use of over-large swords like [[Nodachi]] because they were cumbersome and unwieldy.","images":[]},"[edit] Religion":{"text":"Even from a late age, Musashi separated his religion from his involvement in swordsmanship. Excerpts such as the one below, from The Book of Five Rings, demonstrate a philosophy that is thought to have stayed with him throughout his life:However, the belief that Musashi disliked [[Shinto]] is inaccurate, as he criticises the [[Kashima_Shint%C5%8D-ry%C5%AB]] style of swordsmanship, and not Shinto, the religion. In Musashi's [[Dokkodo]], his stance on religion is further elucidated: \"Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.\"[15]","images":[]},"[edit] Musashi as an artist":{"text":"In his later years, Musashi claimed in his Go Rin No Sho: \"When I apply the principle of strategy to the ways of different arts and crafts, I no longer have need for a teacher in any domain.\" He proved this by creating recognized masterpieces of [[Calligraphy]] and classic [[Ink_painting]]. His paintings are characterized by skilled use of [[Ink_wash]] and an economy of brush stroke. He especially mastered the \"broken ink\" school of landscapes, applying it to other subjects, such as his Kobokumeikakuzu (\"[[Shrike]] Perched on a Withered Branch\"; part of a [[Triptych]] whose other two members were \"[[Hotei]] Walking\" and \"Sparrow on Bamboo\"), his Hotei Watching a Cockfight, and his Rozanzu (\"Wild Geese Among Reeds\").","images":["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Kobokumeigekizu.jpg/150px-Kobokumeigekizu.jpg"]},"[edit] Popular culture":{"text":"Even in Musashi's time there were fictional texts resembling [[Comic_book]]. It is therefore quite difficult to separate fact from fiction when discussing his life. There have been numerous works of fiction made about or featuring Musashi, such as the popular fantasy series \"The Secrets of The Immortal Nicholas Flamel\". Among them are also several dozen [[Film]], including several with the title of Miyamoto Musashi. One of these, released in the English-speaking world as [[Samurai_I:_Musashi_Miyamoto]], is the [[Academy_Award]]–winning film by [[Hiroshi_Inagaki]] starring [[Toshir%C3%B4_Mifune]]. [[Eiji_Yoshikawa]]'s novelization has greatly influenced successive fictional depictions (including the [[Manga]] [[Vagabond_(manga)]] by [[Takehiko_Inoue]]) and is often mistaken for a factual account of Musashi's life.","images":[]},"[edit] External links":{"text":"","images":["http://bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","http://bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.20wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"]}}}
