In its introduction, Pirsig explains that, despite its title, \"it should in no way be associated with that great body of factual information relating to orthodox <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen\">Zen Buddhist</a> practice. It's not very factual on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/motorcycle\">motorcycle</a>s, either.\"</p>\n<p>The book is generally regarded as an American cultural icon in literature.</p>\n<h2>Structure</h2>\n<p>The book describes, in first person, a 17-day journey on his motorcycle from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota\">Minnesota</a> to Northern <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California\">California</a> by the author (though he is not identified in the book) and his son Chris. They are joined for the first nine days of the trip by close friends John and Sylvia Sutherland, with whom they part ways in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana\">Montana</a>. The trip is punctuated by numerous <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy\">philosophical</a> discussions, referred to as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chautauqua\">Chautauqua</a>s by the author, on topics including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epistemology\">epistemology</a>, ethical <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emotivism\">emotivism</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy_of_science\">philosophy of science</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of these discussions are tied together by the story of the narrators own past self, who is referred to in the third person as Phaedrus (after <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedrus_(dialogue)\">Platos dialogue</a>). Phaedrus, a teacher of creative and technical writing at a small college, became engrossed in the question of what defines good writing, and what in general defines good, or \"Quality\". His philosophical investigations eventually drove him insane, and he was subjected to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electroconvulsive_therapy\">electroconvulsive therapy</a> which permanently changed his personality.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the book, Phaedrus's personality begins to re-emerge and the narrator is reconciled with his past.</p>\n<h2>Writing</h2>\n<p>In  a 1974 interview with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR\">National Public Radio</a>, Pirsig stated that the book took him four years to write. During two of these years, Pirsig continued working at his job of writing computer manuals. This caused him to fall into an unorthodox schedule, waking up very early and writing <em>Zen</em> from 2 a.m. until 6 a.m., then eating and going to his day job. He would sleep during his lunch break and then go to bed around 6 in the evening. Pirsig joked that his co-workers noticed that he was \"a lot less perky\" than everyone else.<ref><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4612364\">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance Author Robert Pirsig</a> at NPR online audio archive</ref></p>\n<h2>Philosophical content</h2>\n<p>In Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Pirsig explores the meaning and concept of quality, a term he deems to be undefinable.  Pirsig's thesis is that to truly experience quality one must both embrace and apply it as best fits the requirements of the situation. According to Pirsig, such an approach would avoid a great deal of frustration and dissatisfaction common to modern life.</p>\n<p>In the book, the Narrator describes the \"Romantic\" approach to life of his friend, John Sutherland, who chooses not to learn how to maintain his expensive new motorcycle. John simply hopes for the best with his bike, and when problems do occur he often becomes frustrated, and is forced to rely on professional mechanics to repair it. In contrast, the \"classical\" Narrator has an older motorcycle which he is usually able to diagnose and repair himself through the use of rational <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/problem_solving\">problem solving</a> skills.</p>\n<p>In an example of the classical approach, Pirsig explains to the reader that one must pay continual attention: when the Narrator and his friends came into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_City,_Montana\">Miles City, Montana</a>  he notices that the \"engine idle is loping a little,\" a possible indication that the fuel/air mixture is too <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air–fuel_ratio\">rich</a>. The next day he is thinking of this as he is going through his ritual to adjust the valves on his cycle's engine.  During the adjustment, he notes that both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spark_plug\">spark plug</a>s are black, confirming a rich mixture. He recognizes that the feel-good-higher-altitude-mountain-air is causing the engine to run rich.  New jets are purchased, and installed, and with the valves adjusted, the engine runs well again.</p>\n<p>With this, the book details two types of personalities: those who are interested mostly in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiktionary:Gestalt\">gestalt</a>s (romantic viewpoints, such as Zen, focused on being \"In the moment\", and not on rational analysis), and those who seek to know the details, understand the inner workings, and master the mechanics (classic viewpoints with application of rational analysis, vis-a-vis motorcycle maintenance) and so on.</p>\n<p>The Sutherlands represent an exclusively romantic attitude toward the world. The Narrator initially appears to prefer the classic approach. It later becomes apparent that he understands both viewpoints and is aiming for the middle ground. He understands that technology, and the \"dehumanized world\" it carries with it, appears ugly and repulsive to a romantic person. He knows that such persons are determined to shoehorn all of life's experience into the romantic view. Pirsig is capable of seeing the beauty of technology and feels good about mechanical work, where the goal is \"to achieve an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/inner_peace\">inner peace</a> of mind\". The book demonstrates that motorcycle maintenance may be dull and tedious drudgery or an enjoyable and pleasurable pastime; it all depends on attitude.</p>\n<p>Pirsig examines the modern pursuit of \"Pure <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth\">Truth</a>s\", claiming it derives from the work of early <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_philosophy\">Greek philosophers</a> who were establishing the concept of truth in opposition to the force of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_of_the_Good\">The Good</a>\". He argues that although rational thought may find a truth (or The Truth) it may never be fully and universally applicable to each and every individual's experience. Therefore, what is needed is an approach to viewing life that is more varied and inclusive and has a wider range of application. He makes a case that originally the Greeks did not distinguish between \"Quality\" and \"Truth\" – they were one and the same – and that the divorce was, in fact, artificial (though needed at the time) and is now a source of much frustration and unhappiness in the world, particularly overall dissatisfaction with modern life.</p>\n<p>Pirsig aims towards a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/perception\">perception</a> of the world that embraces both sides, the rational and the romantic. This means encompassing \"irrational\" sources of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wisdom\">wisdom</a> and understanding as well as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/science\">science</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reason\">reason</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technology\">technology</a>. In particular, this must include bursts of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/creativity\">creativity</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intuition_(philosophy)\">intuition</a> that seemingly come from nowhere and are not (in his view) rationally explicable. Pirsig seeks to demonstrate that rationality and Zen-like \"being in the moment\" can harmoniously coexist. He suggests such a combination of rationality and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/romanticism\">romanticism</a> can potentially bring a higher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quality_of_life\">quality of life</a>.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirsig's_metaphysics_of_Quality\">Pirsig's metaphysics of Quality</a></li>\n<li> <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lila:_An_Inquiry_into_Morals\">Lila: An Inquiry into Morals</a></em></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_(philosophy)\">Quality (philosophy)</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_intelligence\">Emotional intelligence</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology\">Gestalt psychology</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumption_trap\">Gumption trap</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_books_about_philosophy\">List of books about philosophy</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<h2>External links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.robertpirsig.org\">robertpirsig.org</a>, A website containing a number of papers concerned with the Metaphysics of Quality.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://venturearete.org/ResearchProjects/ProfessorGurr/gallery/albums.php?set_albumListPage=2/\"> Pictures taken by Pirsig</a> from the trip made famous in his book</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4612364\">Audio: 1974 NPR Interview with Pirsig</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4612367\">Audio: 1992 NPR Interview with Pirsig</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1951397,00.html\">Guardian interview from 2006 Short version</a> and <a href=\"http://robertpirsig.org/Observer%20Interview.htm\">Long version.</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-04-28/#feature\">Motorcycle Maintenance Without the Zen</a>, A featured critique from the Skeptic.com</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"category\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:1974_books\">1974 books</a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"category\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_philosophical_novels\">American philosophical novels</a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"category\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Motorcycle_writing\">Motorcycle writing</a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"category\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Motorcycling_in_fiction\">Motorcycling in fiction</a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"category\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Works_by_Robert_M._Pirsig\">Works by Robert M.

Although the term fiction refers in particular to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/novel\">novel</a>s and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_story\">short stories</a>, it may also refer to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theatre\">theatre</a>, including opera and ballet, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/film\">film</a>, television, poetry and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/song\">song</a>. Fiction contrasts with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-fiction\">non-fiction</a>, which deals exclusively with factual (or, at least, assumed factual) events, descriptions, observations, etc. </p>\n<h2> Features </h2>\n<h3> Realistic fiction </h3>\n<p>Realistic fiction, although untrue, could actually happen. Some events, people, and places may even be real. It may be possible that, in the future, imagined events could physically happen. For example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne\">Jules Verne</a>s novel <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_The_Earth_To_The_Moon\">From The Earth To The Moon</a> was proven possible in 1969, when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong\">Neil Armstrong</a> landed on the Moon. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction\">Science fiction</a> often predicts technologies that later become a reality.</p>\n<p>Another sub-genre that may be included in this is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime_fiction\">crime fiction</a> like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes\">Sherlock Holmes</a> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle\">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot\">Hercule Poirot</a> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie\">Agatha Christie</a>, Gremlin Greaves by Svaj Darwin and so on. All these works depict a fictional but plausible story.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_fiction\">Historical fiction</a> is also a sub-genre that takes fictional characters and puts them into real world events. For example, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Gabaldon\">Diana Gabaldon</a>'s characters in \"The Outlander\" series involves time travel and love in Scotland but also contains historical events such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Culloden\">Battle of Culloden</a>.</p>\n<h3> Non-realistic fiction</h3>\n<p>Non-realistic fiction is that in which the storys events could not happen in real life, which involve an alternate form of history of mankind other than that recorded, or need <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/impossible_technology\">impossible technology</a>. A good deal of fiction books are like this, including works by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Carroll\">Lewis Carroll</a> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alices_Adventures_in_Wonderland\">Alice In Wonderland</a>), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling\">J. K. Rowling</a> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter\">Harry Potter</a>), and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien\">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> (<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings\">The Lord of the Rings</a></em>).</p>\n<p>However, even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fantastic\">fantastic</a> literature is bidimensional: it is situated between the poles of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism\">realism</a> and the marvelous or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythology\">mythic</a>. Geographical details, character descriptions etc. create a rhetoric of realism, which \"invites the reader to ignore the texts artifice, to suspend ones disbelief, exercise poetic faith and thereby indulge in the narratives imaginative world\". The bidimensionality appears within the story as astonishment or frightening. According to G. W. Young and G. Wolfe, fictional realities outside the text are evoked, and the readers previous conceptions of reality are exposed as incomplete. Hence, \"by fiction is one able to gain even fuller constructs of what constitutes reality\". On the other hand, the infinite fictional possibilities signal the impossibility of fully knowing reality. There is no criterion to measure constructs of reality – in the last resort they are \"entirely fictional\".(ref: subversive)</p>\n<h3> Semi-fiction</h3>\n<p>Semi-fiction is fiction implementing a great deal of non-fiction,(ref: The Role of Narrative Fiction and Semi-Fiction in Organizational Studies)</p>\n<p>Often, even when the author claims the story is true, there may be significant additions and subtractions from the true story to make it more suitable for storytelling.</p>\n<h2>Quotes</h2>\n<p>Even among writing instructors and bestselling authors, there is little consensus regarding the number and composition of the fundamental elements of fiction. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> \"Fiction has three main elements: plotting, character, and place or setting.\" [ Morrell  2006  p = 151]</li>\n<li> \"A charged image evokes all the other elements of your story—theme, character, conflict, setting, style, and so on.\" [ Writer's Digest Handbook of Novel Writing  1992  p = 160]</li>\n<li> \"For writers, the spices you add to make your plot your own include characters, setting, and dialogue.\" [ Bell  2004 p = 16]</li>\n<li> \"Contained within the framework of a story are the major story elements: characters, action, and conflict.\" [ Evanovich  2006  p = 83]</li>\n<li> \". . . I think point of view is one of the most fundamental elements of the fiction-writing craft . . . .\" [ Selgin  2007  p = 41]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As stated by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Evanovich\">Janet Evanovich</a>, \"Effective writing requires an understanding of the fundamental elements of storytelling, such as point of view, dialogue, and setting. \" [ Evanovich  2006  p = 39] The debate continues as to the number and composition of the fundamental elements of fiction. [date=February 2011]</p>\n<h2>Elements</h2>\n<h3> Plot </h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plot_(narrative)\">Plot</a> is what the character(s) did, said, and thought. It is the Action Proper given unity by the Enveloping Action, the Universal Action, the Archetypal Action. As Aristotle said, What gives a story unity is not as the masses believe that it is about one person but that it is about one action. Plot, or storyline, is often listed as one of the fundamental elements of fiction. It is the rendering and ordering of the events and actions of a story. On a micro level, plot consists of action and reaction, also referred to as stimulus and response. On a macro level, plot has a beginning, a middle, and an ending. Plot is often depicted as an arc with a zig-zag line to represent the rise and fall of action. Plot also has a mid-level structure: scene and summary. </p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scene_(fiction)\">scene</a> is a unit of drama – where the action occurs. Then, after a transition of some sort, comes the summary – an emotional reaction and regrouping, an aftermath. For a delightful tongue-in-cheek comment on plot, see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Anne_Porter\">Katherine Anne Porter</a>s \"No Plot, My Dear, No Story\" in The Occasional Writings and Collected Essays of Katherine Anne Porter, Seymour Lawrence, 1970.</p>\n<h4> Exposition </h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_(literary_technique)\">Exposition</a> is the portion of a narrative that introduces important background information to the reader (like events occurring before the main plot or a characters <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/backstory\">backstory</a>) but is not part of the plots action itself.<ref><span class=\"reference\" data-type=\"book \" data- year =\" 2009 \" data- title =\" Kaplan SAT Subject Test: Literature 2009-2010 Edition \" data- publisher =\" Kaplan Publishing \" data- page =\" 60 \" data- isbn=\" 1419552619\"></span></ref> If the exposition is too <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/didactic\">didactic</a>, it can kill the plots momentum. Therefore a number of literary techniques are used to hide from, or otherwise misdirect, the readers attention. These techniques include: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)\">flashbacks</a>, incidental dialog (having a character refer to his sister as \"Sis\"), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_narrative\">first-person</a> thoughts of the past (\"Years ago, when I was serving in Africa...\") or projections into the future (\"It was not until years later when I learned that...\") and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/third-person_narrative\">third-person</a>, all-seeing narrative but split up into small pieces spread throughout the story.</p>\n<h4> Foreshadowing </h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadowing\">Foreshadowing</a> is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_technique\">technique</a> used by authors to provide clues so the reader can predict what might occur <em>later</em> in the story. An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/author\">author</a> drops subtle hints about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)\">plot</a> developments to come later in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/narrative\">story</a>. It prepares the reader for later action and subsequent images so that the reader or spectator is not jarred and verisimilitude is maintained even in science fiction, fantasy, magical realism, and other genres that might otherwise test credulity. If such preparation is recognized as such by the reader or spectator, it may be ineffective and artificial.</p>\n<h4> Rising action </h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rising_action\">rising action</a>, in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/narratology\">narrative</a> of a work of fiction, follows the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_(literary_technique)\">exposition</a> and leads up to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_(narrative)\">climax</a>. The rising action's purpose is usually to build suspense all the way up the climactic finish. The rising action should not be confused with the middle of the story, but is the action right before the climax. The material beyond the climax is known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falling_action\">falling action</a>.</p>\n<h4> Climax </h4>\n<p>In a work of fiction, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_(narrative)\">climax</a> often resembles that of the classical comedy, occurring near the end of the text or performance, after the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rising_action\">rising action</a> and before the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falling_action\">falling action</a>. It is the moment of greatest danger for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protagonist\">protagonist</a>(s) and usually consists of a seemingly inevitable prospect of failure – it surprises you to the point that gets you excited to see what is to come in the end.</p>\n<p>A climax often includes three elements. The most important element is that the protagonist experiences a change. The main character discovers something about himself or herself, and another unknown character. The last element is revealing the theme itself.</p>\n<h4> Falling action </h4>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falling_action\">falling action</a> is the part of a story, usually found in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tragedy\">tragedies</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/short_story\">short stories</a>, following the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climax_(narrative)\">climax</a> and showing the effects of the climax. It leads up to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/denouement\">denouement</a> (or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catastrophe_(drama)\">catastrophe</a>).(ref: fall1)</p>\n<h4> Resolution </h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denouement\">Resolution</a> occurs after the climax, where the conflict is resolved. It may contain a moment of final suspense, during which the final outcome of the conflict is in doubt.</p>\n<h3> Conflict </h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_(narrative)\">Conflict</a> is generally speaking a necessary element of fictional <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literature\">literature</a>. As Brooks and Warren said in <em>Understanding Fiction</em> and as many others have noted, no conflict, no story. Often it is difficult for readers to discern conflict in sophisticated fiction but its locus is always focused on the protagonist. In order for the story to engage the reader or spectator, the conflict can usually be discerned as immediate, urgent, and insoluble. Furthermore, the conflict that is one between good and evil depends upon whether the reader or spectator prefers good or evil and is thus a slight story at best. It is defined as the problem in any piece of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literature\">literature</a> and is often classified according to the nature of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protagonist\">protagonist</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antagonist\">antagonist</a>, as follows:</p>\n<h4> Types of conflict </h4>\n<p>There are five widely cited types of conflict. Many other types of conflict such as <strong>Person vs. God</strong> are generally thought to fall into one of these categories. In many ancient cultures <strong>Person vs. Fate</strong> would often constitute the conflict of the story. In modern times, <strong>Person vs. Machine</strong>, also known as <strong>Person vs. Technology</strong>, has become another one.(ref: name)</p>\n<p><strong>Person vs. Self</strong> is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)\">theme</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literature\">literature</a> that places a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fictional_character\">character</a> against their own <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/will_(philosophy)\">will</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/confusion\">confusion</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fear\">fear</a>s. Person vs. Self can also be where a character tries to find out who they are or comes to a realization or a change in character. Although the struggle is internal, the character can be influenced by external forces. The struggle of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_being\">human being</a> to come to a decision is the basis of Person vs. Self. Examples include the titular character of <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf\">Beowulf</a></em>. More recently, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards\">Academy Award</a> winning movie <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(film)\">A Beautiful Mind</a></em> has been posited as an application of Person vs. Self. Faulkner in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech noted that the great stories are those of the human heart in conflict with itself. With that in mind the other conflicts enumerated here can fade into the background as part of the setting rather than the conflict-in-itself of any given story. A simple, ready example may be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_London\">Jack London</a>'s \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Build_a_Fire\">To Build a Fire</a>\" wherein we can see that the conflict is not Man vs. Nature but Man vs. His Own Nature.</p>\n<p><strong>Person vs. Person</strong> is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)\">theme</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literature\">literature</a> in which the main characters <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_(narrative)\">conflict</a> with another person is the focus of the story. An example is the heros conflicts with the central villain of a work, which may play a large role in the plot and contribute to the development of both characters. There are usually several confrontations before the climax is reached. The conflict is external. An example is the conflict between Judah and Messala in <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur:_A_Tale_of_the_Christ\">Ben-Hur</a></em>, as would be the conflict between a bully and his victim.</p>\n<p><strong>Person vs. Society</strong> is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)\">theme</a> in fiction in which a main characters, or group of main characters, main source of conflict is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conditioning\">social tradition</a>s or concepts. In this sense, the two parties are: a) the protagonist(s); b) the society of which the protagonist(s) are included. Society itself is often looked at as a single character, just as an opposing party would be looked at in a <em>Person vs. Person</em> conflict. This can also be one protagonist against a group or society of antagonists or society led by some antagonistic force. Examples in literature would include the short story \"The Ones that Walk away from Omelas\" by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin\">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> or the novel <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights\">Wuthering Heights</a></em> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Brontë\">Emily Brontë</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Person vs. Nature</strong> is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)\">theme</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literature\">literature</a> that places a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fictional_character\">character</a> against forces of nature. Many <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disaster_film\">disaster film</a>s focus on this theme, which is predominant within many survival stories. It is also strong in stories about struggling for survival in remote locales, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Paulson\">Gary Paulson</a>s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchet_(novel)\">Hatchet</a><strong>or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_London\">Jack London</a></strong>s short story \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Build_a_Fire\">To Build a Fire</a>\".</p>\n<p><strong>Person vs. Supernatural</strong> is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)\">theme</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literature\">literature</a> that places a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fictional_character\">character</a> against <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/supernatural\">supernatural</a> forces. When an entity is in conflict with him-, her-, or itself, the conflict is categorized as <strong>internal</strong>, otherwise, it is <strong>external</strong>. Such stories are often seen in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalytic_literary_criticism\">Freudian Criticism</a> as representations of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego\">id vs. superego</a>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Stoker\">Bram Stoker</a>s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula\">Dracula</a><strong>is a good example of this, as well as </strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein\">Frankenstein</a><strong>by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley\">Mary Shelley</a> and </strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christabel_(poem)\">Christabel</a> by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Coleridge\">Samuel Coleridge</a>. It is also very common in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comic_book\">comic book</a>s.</p>\n<h3> Character </h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization\">Characterization</a> is often listed as one of the fundamental elements of fiction. A character is a participant in the story, and is usually a person, but may be any personal identity, or entity whose existence originates from a fictional work or performance.</p>\n<p>Characters may be of several types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_(literature)\">Point-of-view</a> character: The character from whose perspective (theme) the audience experiences the story. This is the character that represents the point of view the audience empathizes, or at the very least, sympathies with. Therefore this is the \"Main\" Character.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist\">Protagonist</a>: The driver of the action of the story and therefore responsible for achieving the story's Objective Story Goal (the surface journey). In western storytelling tradition the Protagonist is usually the main character.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist\">Antagonist</a>: A person, or a group of people (antagonists) who oppose the main character, or main characters. The Antagonist rarely succeeds the end of the book/series.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_character\">Static character</a>: A character who does not significantly change during the course of a story.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_character\">Dynamic character</a>: A character who undergoes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization#Character_development\">character development</a> during the course of a story.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(literature)\">Foil</a>: The character that contrasts to the protagonist in a way that illuminates their personality or characteristic.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporting_character\">Supporting character</a>: A character that plays a part in the plot, but is not major</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_character\">Minor character</a>: A character in a bit/<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance\">cameo</a> part.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3> Methods of developing characters </h3>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_physical_appearance\">Appearance</a> explains or describes the character's outward appearance so the readers can picture them, and identify them relative to other characters.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue\">Dialogue</a> is what characters say and how they say it.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_(literature)\">Action</a> is what characters do and how they do it.</li>\n<li> Reaction of others is how other characters see and treat a main character.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3> Symbolism </h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolism_(arts)\">Symbolism</a> is the applied use of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symbol\">symbol</a>s: iconic representations that carry particular conventional meanings.</p>\n<p>The term \"symbolism\" is limited to use in contrast to \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/representationalism\">representationalism</a>\"; defining the general directions of a linear <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spectrum_(disambiguation)\">spectrum</a> – where in all symbolic concepts can be viewed in relation, and where changes in context may imply systemic changes to individual and collective definitions of symbols. \"Symbolism\" may refer to a way of choosing representative symbols in line with abstract rather than literal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/property\">properties</a>, allowing for the broader interpretation of a carried <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(semiotics)\">meaning</a> than more literal concept-representations allow. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion\">religion</a> can be described as a language of concepts related to human <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spirituality\">spirituality</a>. Symbolism hence is an important aspect of most <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_symbolism\">religions</a>.</p>\n<p>The interpretation of abstract symbols has had an important role in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion\">religion</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychoanalysis\">psychoanalysis</a>. As envisioned by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud\">Sigmund Freud</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung\">Carl Jung</a>, symbols are not the creations of mind, but rather are distinct capacities within the mind to hold a distinct piece of information. In the mind, the symbol can find free association with any number of other symbols, can be organized in any number of ways, and can hold the connected meanings between symbols as symbols in themselves. Jung and Freud diverged on the issue of common cognitive symbol systems and whether they could exist only within the individual mind or among other minds; whether any cognitive symbolism was defined by innate symbolism or by the influence of the environment around them.</p>\n<h3> Metaphor </h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor\">Metaphor</a> (from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language\">Greek language</a>: Meaning \"apply\", literally \"carry across\") is language that directly compares seemingly unrelated subjects. It is a figure of speech that compares two or more things not using like or as. In the simplest case, this takes the form: \"The <em>first subject</em> is a <em>second subject</em>.\" More generally, a metaphor is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhetoric\">rhetoric</a>al <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(linguistics)\">trope</a> that describes a first subject as <em>being</em> or <em>equal to</em> a second object in some way. Thus, the first subject can be economically described because implicit and explicit attributes from the second subject are used to enhance the description of the first. This is known for usage in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literature\">literature</a>, especially in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poetry\">poetry</a>, where with few words, emotions and associations from one context are associated with objects and entities in a different context. A simpler definition is the comparison of two unrelated things without using the words \"like\" or \"as\".</p>\n<p>The term derives from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language\">Greek</a> <em>μεταφορά</em> (<em>metaphora</em>), or \"transference\",(ref: tufts)<em>μεταφέρω</em> (<em>metaphero</em>) \"to carry over, to transfer\"(ref: tufts1)<em>μετά</em> (<em>meta</em>), \"between\"(ref: tufts2)<em>φέρω</em> (<em>phero</em>), \"to bear, to carry\".(ref: tufts3)</p>\n<h2> Types of plots </h2>\n<h3> Chronological order </h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chronological_order\">chronological order</a>, all of the events occur in the text in the order they happen. There may be references to events from the past or future, however the events are written in time order. There are no flashbacks or flash-forwards.</p>\n<h3> Flashback </h3>\n<p>In history, film, television and other media, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)\">flashback</a> (also called analepsis) is an interjected <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scene_(fiction)\">scene</a> that takes the narrative back in time from the current point the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)\">story</a> has reached. Flashbacks are often used to recount events that happened prior to the storys primary sequence of events or to fill in crucial <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/backstory\">backstory</a>. Character origin flashbacksspecifically refers to flashbacks dealing with key events early in a characters development (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman\">Clark Kent</a> discovering he could fly, for example, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist\">the Elric brothers</a> attempt to bring back their mother). The television show <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(2004_TV_series)\">Lost</a> is particularly well known for extensive use of flashbacks in almost every episode. In the opposite direction, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flashforward\">flashforward</a> (or prolepsis) reveals events that occur in the future. The technique is used to create suspense in a story, or develop a character. In literature, internal analepsisis a flashback to an earlier point in the narrative; external analepsis is a flashback to before the narrative started.</p>\n<h3> Setting </h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setting_(fiction)\">Setting</a>, the location and time of a story, is often listed as one of the fundamental elements of fiction. Sometimes setting is referred to as <strong>milieu</strong>, to include a context (such as society) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. In some cases, setting becomes a character itself and can set the tone of a story [Rozelle2005p=2].</p>\n<h3> Theme </h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)\">Theme</a>, a conceptual distillation of the story, is often listed as one of the fundamental elements of fiction. It is the central idea or insight serving as a unifying element, creating cohesion and is an answer to the question, What did you learn from the piece of fiction? In some cases a story's theme is a prominent element and somewhat unmistakable [Morrell2006p=263].</p>\n<h3> Style </h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(fiction)\">Style</a> is not so much <em>what</em> is written, but <em>how</em> it is written and interpreted. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(fiction)\">Style</a> in fiction refers to language conventions used to construct the story or article. A fiction writer may manipulate diction, sentence structure, phrasing, dialogue, and other aspects of language to create style or mood. The communicative effect created by the authors style is sometimes referred to as the storys voice. Every writer has his or her own unique style, or voice [Provost1988p=8]. Style is sometimes listed as one of the fundamental elements of fiction.</p>\n<p>Writer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Roth\">Philip Roth</a> defined the \"<em>sensuous</em> aspects of fiction\" as \"tone, mood, voice, and, among other things, the juxtaposition of the narrative events themselves\".(ref: Reading)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the information gain is poor!</p>\n<h2> Types of mythic fantasy </h2>\n<p>Genre Fantasy, based on the use of mythologies of the peoples of the world 9.

For example, in a religious discussion between friends, one might say (attempting humor), \"You might disagree, but in my reality, everyone goes to heaven.\"</p>\n<p>Reality can be defined in a way that links it to world views or parts of them (conceptual frameworks): Reality is the totality of all things, structures (actual and conceptual), events (past and present) and phenomena, whether observable or not. It is what a world view (whether it be based on individual or shared human experience) ultimately attempts to describe or map.</p>\n<p>Certain ideas from physics, philosophy, sociology, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/literary_criticism\">literary criticism</a>, and other fields shape various theories of reality. One such belief is that there simply and literally <em>is</em> no reality beyond the perceptions or beliefs we each have about reality. Such attitudes are summarized in the popular statement, \"Perception is reality\" or \"Life is how you perceive reality\" or \"reality is what you can get away with\" (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson\">Robert Anton Wilson</a>), and they indicate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-realism\">anti-realism</a>&nbsp;&ndash; that is, the view that there is no objective reality, whether acknowledged explicitly or not.</p>\n<p>Many of the concepts of science and philosophy are often defined <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture\">culturally</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sociology\">socially</a>. This idea was elaborated by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn\">Thomas Kuhn</a> in his book <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions\">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a></em> (1962). <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Construction_of_Reality\">The Social Construction of Reality</a></em>, a book about the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sociology_of_knowledge\">sociology of knowledge</a> written by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._Berger\">Peter L. Berger</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Luckmann\">Thomas Luckmann</a>, was published in 1966.</p>\n<h2> Western philosophy </h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\">Philosophy</a> addresses two different aspects of the topic of reality: the nature of reality itself, and the relationship between the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mind\">mind</a> (as well as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language\">language</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture\">culture</a>) and reality.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ontology\">ontology</a> is the study of being, and the central topic of the field is couched, variously, in terms of being, existence, \"what is\", and reality. The task in ontology is to describe the most general <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/category_of_being\">categories of reality</a> and how they are interrelated. If a philosopher wanted to proffer a positive definition of the concept \"reality\", it would be done under this heading. As explained above, some philosophers draw a distinction between reality and existence. In fact, many analytic philosophers today tend to avoid the term \"real\" and \"reality\" in discussing ontological issues. But for those who would treat \"is real\" the same way they treat \"exists\", one of the leading questions of analytic philosophy has been whether existence (or reality) is a property of objects. It has been widely held by analytic philosophers that it is <em>not</em> a property at all, though this view has lost some ground in recent decades.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, particularly in discussions of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)\">objectivity</a> that have feet in both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaphysics\">metaphysics</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epistemology\">epistemology</a>, philosophical discussions of \"reality\" often concern the ways in which reality is, or is not, in some way <em>dependent upon</em> (or, to use fashionable <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jargon\">jargon</a>, \"constructed\" out of) mental and cultural factors such as perceptions, beliefs, and other mental states, as well as cultural artifacts, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion\">religion</a>s and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_movement\">political movement</a>s, on up to the vague notion of a common cultural <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_view\">world view</a>, or <em lang=\"de\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltanschauung\">Weltanschauung</a></em>.</p>\n<p>The view that there is a reality independent of any beliefs, perceptions, etc., is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism\">realism</a>. More specifically, philosophers are given to speaking about \"realism <em>about</em>\" this and that, such as realism about universals or realism about the external world. Generally, where one can identify any class of object, the existence or essential characteristics of which is said not to depend on perceptions, beliefs, language, or any other human artifact, one can speak of \"realism <em>about</em>\" that object.</p>\n<p>One can also speak of <em>anti</em>-realism about the same objects. <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism\">Anti-realism</a></em> is the latest in a long series of terms for views opposed to realism. Perhaps the first was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/idealism_(philosophy)\">idealism</a>, so called because reality was said to be in the mind, or a product of our <em>ideas</em>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeleyan_idealism\">Berkeleyan idealism</a> is the view, propounded by the Irish <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empiricism\">empiricist</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley\">George Berkeley</a>, that the objects of perception are actually ideas in the mind. In this view, one might be tempted to say that reality is a \"mental construct\"; this is not quite accurate, however, since in Berkeleys view perceptual ideas are created and coordinated by God. By the 20th century, views similar to Berkeleys were called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phenomenalism\">phenomenalism</a>. Phenomenalism differs from Berkeleyan idealism primarily in that Berkeley believed that minds, or souls, are not merely ideas nor made up of ideas, whereas varieties of phenomenalism, such as that advocated by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell\">Russell</a>, tended to go farther to say that the mind itself is merely a collection of perceptions, memories, etc., and that there is no mind or soul over and above such <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mental_event\">mental event</a>s. Finally, anti-realism became a fashionable term for <em>any</em> view which held that the existence of some object depends upon the mind or cultural artifacts. The view that the so-called external world is really merely a social, or cultural, artifact, called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_constructionism\">social constructionism</a>, is one variety of anti-realism. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_relativism\">Cultural relativism</a> is the view that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_issues\">social issues</a> such as morality are not absolute, but at least partially <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_artifact\">cultural artifact</a>.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/correspondence_theory\">correspondence theory</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knowledge\">knowledge</a> about what exists claims that \"true\" knowledge of reality represents accurate correspondence of statements about and images of reality with the actual reality that the statements or images are attempting to represent. For example, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_method\">scientific method</a> can <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism\">verify</a> that a statement is true based on the observable evidence that a thing exists. Many humans can point to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains\">Rocky Mountains</a> and say that this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mountain_range\">mountain range</a> exists, and continues to exist even if no one is observing it or making statements about it.</p>\n<h3>Being</h3>\n<p>The nature of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/being\">being</a> is a perennial topic in metaphysics. For, instance <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides\">Parmenides</a> taught that reality was a single unchanging Being, whereas <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus\">Heraclitus</a> wrote that all things flow. The 20th century philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidegger\">Heidegger</a> thought previous philosophers have lost sight the question of Being (qua Being) in favour of the questions of beings (existing things), so that a return to the Parmenidean approach was needed. An <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ontological_catalogue\">ontological catalogue</a> is an attempt to list the fundamental constituents of reality. The question of whether or not <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/existence\">existence</a> is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:predicate\">predicate</a> has been discussed since the Early Modern period, not least in relation to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ontological_argument_for_the_existence_of_God\">ontological argument for the existence of God</a>. Existence, <em>that</em> something is, has been contrasted with <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/essence\">essence</a></em>, the question of <em>what</em> something is.</p>\n<p>Since existence without essence seems blank, it associated with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nothingness\">nothingness</a> by philosophers such as Hegel. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism\">Nihilism</a> represents an extremely negative view of being, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/absolute_(philosophy)\">absolute</a> a positive one.</p>\n<h3> Perception </h3>\n<p>The question of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/direct_realism\">direct or \"naïve\" realism</a>, as opposed to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indirect_realism\">indirect or \"representational\" realism</a>, arises in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy_of_perception\">philosophy of perception</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy_of_mind\">of mind</a> out of the debate over the nature of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness\">conscious</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia\">experience</a>;<ref name=lehar>Lehar, Steve.

The theory states that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from their beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence \"Truth is in the eye of the beholder\". His ideas influenced the work of his friend <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson\">Robert Anton Wilson</a>.</p>\n<h3> Abstract objects and mathematics </h3>\n<p>The status of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(mathematics)\">abstract</a> entities, particularly numbers, is a topic of discussion in mathematics.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy_of_mathematics\">philosophy of mathematics</a>, the best known form of realism about numbers is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_realism\">Platonic realism</a>, which grants them abstract, immaterial existence. Other forms of realism identify mathematics with the concrete physical universe.</p>\n<p>Anti-realist stances include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/formalism_(mathematics)\">formalism</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mathematical_fictionalism\">fictionalism</a>.</p>\n<p>Some approaches are selectively realistic about some mathematical objects but not others. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finitism\">Finitism</a> rejects <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity\">infinite</a> quantities. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ultra-finitism\">ultra-finitism</a> accepts finite quantities up to a certain amount. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics)\">Constructivism</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/intuitionism\">intuitionism</a> are realistic about objects that can be explicitly constructed, but reject the use of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principle_of_the_excluded_middle\">principle of the excluded middle</a> to prove existence by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reductio_ad_absurdum\">reductio ad absurdum</a>.</p>\n<p>The traditional debate has focused on whether an abstract (immaterial, intelligible) realm of numbers has existed <em>in addition to</em> the physical (sensible, concrete) world. A recent development is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mathematical_universe_hypothesis\">mathematical universe hypothesis</a>, the theory that <em>only</em> a mathematical world exists, with the finite, physical world being an illusion within it.</p>\n<p>An extreme form of realism about mathematics is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mathematical_multiverse_hypothesis\">mathematical multiverse hypothesis</a> advanced by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Tegmark\">Max Tegmark</a>. Tegmarks sole postulate is: All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically<em>.

The theory can be considered a form of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism\">Platonism</a> in that it posits the existence of mathematical entities, but can also be considered a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy_of_mathematics\">mathematical monism</a> in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects.</p>\n<h3> Properties </h3>\n<p>The problem of universals is an ancient problem in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaphysics\">metaphysics</a> about whether <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_(metaphysics)\">universals</a> exist. Universals are general or abstract qualities, characteristics, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/property_(philosophy)\">properties</a>, kinds or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/relation_(philosophy)\">relation</a>s, such as being male/female, solid/liquid/gas or a certain colour, that can be predicated of individuals or particulars or that individuals or particulars can be regarded as sharing or participating in. For example, Scott, Pat, and Chris have in common the universal quality of <em>being human</em> or <em>humanity</em>.</p>\n<p>The realist school claims that universals are real&nbsp;&ndash; they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_realism\">Platonic realism</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotelian_realism\">Aristotelian realism</a>. <em>Platonic realism</em> is the view that universals are real entities and they exist independent of particulars. <em>Aristotelian realism</em>, on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism\">Nominalism</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conceptualism\">conceptualism</a> are the main forms of anti-realism about universals.</p>\n<h3> Time and space </h3>\n<p>A traditional <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism\">realist</a> position in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ontology\">ontology</a> is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism\">Idealists</a> deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anti-realism\">anti-realists</a> whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant\">Kant</a>, in the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critique_of_Pure_Reason\">Critique of Pure Reason</a></em>, described time as an <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori\">a priori</a></em> notion that, together with other <em>a priori</em> notions such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/space\">space</a>, allows us to comprehend <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empirical_evidence\">sense experience</a>. Kant denies that either space or time are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory\">substance</a>, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds rather that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/measurement\">measurement</a>s are used to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantity\">quantify</a> how far apart <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_body\">object</a>s are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime#Basic_concepts\">event</a>s. Although</p>\n<p>space and time are held to be <em>transcedentally ideal</em> in this sense, they are also <em>empirically real</em>, i.e. not mere illusions.</p>\n<p>Idealist writers such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._E._McTaggart\">J. M. E. McTaggart</a> in <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreality_of_Time\">The Unreality of Time</a></em> have argued that time is an illusion.</p>\n<p>As well as differing about the reality of time as a whole, metaphysical theories of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time\">time</a> can differ in their ascriptions of reality to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/past\">past</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/present\">present</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/future\">future</a> separately.</p>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(philosophy_of_time)\">Presentism</a> holds that the past and future are unreal, and only an ever changing present is real.</li>\n<li> The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/block_universe\">block universe</a> theory, also known as Eternalism, holds that past, present and future are all real, but the passage of time is an illusion. It is often said to have a scientific basis in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity\">relativity</a>.</li>\n<li> The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/growing_block_universe\">growing block universe</a> theory holds that past and present are real, but the future is not.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Time, and the related concepts of process and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolution\">evolution</a> are central to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/system-building_metaphysics\">system-building metaphysics</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._N._Whitehead\">A. N. Whitehead</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Hartshorne\">Charles Hartshorne</a>.</p>\n<h3> Possible worlds </h3>\n<p>The term \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/possible_world\">possible world</a>\" goes back to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz\">Leibniz's</a> theory of possible worlds, used to analyse <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/necessity\">necessity</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_possibility\">possibility</a>, and similar <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modal_logic\">modal notions</a>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_realism\">Modal realism</a> is the view, notably propounded by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kellogg_Lewis\">David Kellogg Lewis</a>, that all <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/possible_worlds\">possible worlds</a> are as real as the actual world. In short: the actual world is regarded as merely one among an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infinity\">infinite</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/set_theory\">set</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logically_possible\">logically possible</a> worlds, some \"nearer\" to the actual world and some more remote. Other theorists may use the Possible World framework to express and explore problems without committing to it ontologically.</p>\n<p>Possible world theory is related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alethic_logic\">alethic logic</a>: a proposition is <em>necessary</em> if it is true in all possible worlds, and <em>possible</em> if it is true in at least one. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/many_worlds_interpretation\">many worlds interpretation</a> of quantum mechanics is a similar idea in science.</p>\n<h3>Theories of everything (TOE) and philosophy</h3>\n<p>The philosophical implications of a physical TOE are frequently debated. For example, if philosophical <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/physicalism\">physicalism</a> is true, a physical TOE will coincide with a philosophical theory of everything.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics#Styles_and_methods_of_metaphysics\">\"system building\"</a> style of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaphysics\">metaphysics</a> attempts to answer <em>all</em> the important questions in a coherent way, providing a complete picture of the world. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato\">Plato</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle\">Aristotle</a> could be said to be early examples of comprehensive systems. In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building <em>scope</em> of philosophy is often linked to the ratioanlist <em>method</em> of philosophy,that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure <em>a priori</em> reason. Examples from the early modern period include the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz\">Leibniz</a>s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monadology\">Monadology</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René_Descartes\">Descarte</a>s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism\">Dualism</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza\">Spinoza</a>s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism\">Monism</a>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel\">Hegel</a>s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_idealism\">Absolute idealism</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead\">Whitehead</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy\">Process philosophy</a> were later systems.</p>\n<p>Other philosophers do not believe its techniques can aim so high. Some scientists think a more mathematical approach than philosophy is needed for a TOE, for instance <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking\">Stephen Hawking</a> wrote in <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Time\">A Brief History of Time</a></em> that even if we had a TOE, it would necessarily be a set of equations. He wrote, \"What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?\".<ref>as quoted in Artigas, <em>The Mind of the Universe</em>, p.123</ref></p>\n<h3>Phenomenological reality</h3>\n<p>On a much broader and more subjective level,[date=August 2011] private experiences, curiosity, inquiry, and the selectivity involved in personal interpretation of events shapes reality as seen by one and only one individual[date=August 2011] and hence is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(philosophy)\">phenomenological</a>. While this</p>\n<p>form of reality might be common to others as well, it could at times also be so unique to oneself as to never be experienced or agreed upon by anyone else. Much of the kind of experience deemed <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality\">spiritual</a> occurs on this level of reality.</p>\n<p>Phenomenology is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophical_method\">philosophical method</a> developed in the early years of the twentieth century by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl\">Edmund Husserl</a> and a circle of followers at the universities of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Göttingen\">Göttingen</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich\">Munich</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany\">Germany</a>. Subsequently, phenomenological themes were taken up by philosophers in France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's work.</p>\n<p>The word <em>phenomenology</em> comes from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language\">Greek</a> <em>phainómenon</em>, meaning \"that which appears\", and <em>lógos</em>, meaning \"study\".

Such reflection was to take place from a highly modified \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_narrative\">first person</a>\" viewpoint, studying phenomena not as they appear to \"my\" consciousness, but to any consciousness whatsoever. Husserl believed that phenomenology could thus provide a firm basis for all human <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/knowledge\">knowledge</a>, including scientific knowledge, and could establish philosophy as a \"rigorous science\".<ref><span class=\"reference\" data-type=\"book \" data- author =\" Joseph Kockelmans \" data- year =\" 2001 \" data- title =\" Edmund Husserls phenomenology \" data- edition =\" 2 \" data- publisher =\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_University\">Purdue University</a> Press \" data- pages =\" 311–314 \" data- isbn =\" 1-55753-050-5\"></span></ref></p>\n<p>Husserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticised and developed not only by himself, but also by his student and assistant <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger\">Martin Heidegger</a>, by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/existentialists\">existentialists</a>, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Merleau-Ponty\">Maurice Merleau-Ponty</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>, and by other philosophers, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ricoeur\">Paul Ricoeur</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Levinas\">Emmanuel Levinas</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietrich_von_Hildebrand\">Dietrich von Hildebrand</a>.<ref><span class=\"reference\" data-type=\"book \" data- author =\" Steven Galt Crowell \" data- year =\" 2001 \" data- title =\" Husserl, Heidegger, and the space of meaning: paths toward transcendental phenomenology \" data- publisher =\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_University\">Northwestern University</a> Press \" data- page =\" 160 \" data- isbn =\" 0-8101-1805-X\"></span></ref></p>\n<h3>Skeptical hypotheses</h3>\n<p>Skeptical hypotheses in philosophy suggest that reality is very different from what we think it is; or at least that we cannot prove it is not. Examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> The \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_in_a_vat\">Brain in a vat</a>\" hypothesis is cast in scientific terms. It supposes that one might be a disembodied brain kept alive in a vat, and fed false sensory signals, by a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mad_scientist\">mad scientist</a>.</li>\n<li> The \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_argument\">Dream argument</a>\" of Descartes and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuangzi\">Zhuangzi</a> supposes reality to be indistinguishable from a dream.</li>\n<li> Descarte's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon\">Evil demon</a> is a being \"as clever and deceitful as he is powerful, who has directed his entire effort to misleading me.\"</li>\n<li> The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/five_minute_hypothesis\">five minute hypothesis</a> (or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omphalos_hypothesis\">omphalos hypothesis</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Thursdayism\">Last Thursdayism</a>) suggests that the world was created recently together with records and traces indicating a greater age.</li>\n<li> The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_hypothesis\">Matrix hypothesis</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_reality_hypothesis\">Simulated reality hypothesis</a> suggest that we might be inside a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/computer_simulation\">computer simulation</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virtual_reality\">virtual reality</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical sciences</h2>\n<h3>Scientific realism</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_realism\">Scientific realism</a> is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science (perhaps ideal science) is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be. Within <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy_of_science\">philosophy of science</a>, it is often framed as an answer to the question \"how is the success of science to be explained?\" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of entities that are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unobservables\">not directly observable</a> discussed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_theory\">scientific theories</a>. Generally, those who are scientific realists state that one can make reliable claims about these entities (viz., that they have the same <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology\">ontological</a> status) as directly observable entities, as opposed to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instrumentalism\">instrumentalism</a>.</p>\n<h3>Realism and locality in physics</h3>\n<p><em>Realism</em> in the sense used by physicists does not equate to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism\">realism</a> in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaphysics\">metaphysics</a>.<ref><a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0607057v2\">Norsen, T. &ndash; Against \"Realism\"</a></ref></p>\n<p>The latter is the claim that the world is mind-independent: that even if the results of a measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer. Furthermore, a mind-independent property does not have to be the value of some physical variable such as position or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/momentum\">momentum</a>. A property can be <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disposition\">disposition</a>al</em> (or potential), i.e. it can be a tendency: in the way that glass objects tend to break, or are disposed to break, even if they do not <em>actually</em> break. Likewise, the mind-independent properties of quantum systems could consist of a tendency to respond to particular measurements with particular values with ascertainable probability.<ref><a href=\"http://www.generativescience.org/\">Ian Thomsons dispositional quantum mechanics</a></ref> Such an ontology would be metaphysically realistic, without being realistic in the physicists sense of \"local realism\" (which would require that a single value be produced with certainty).</p>\n<p>A closely related term is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/counterfactual_definiteness\">counterfactual definiteness</a> (CFD), used to refer to the claim that one can meaningfully speak of the definiteness of results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e. the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_realism\">Local realism</a> is a significant feature of classical mechanics, of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_relativity\">general relativity</a>, and of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electrodynamics\">electrodynamics</a>; but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantum_mechanics\">quantum mechanics</a> has shown that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantum_entanglement\">quantum entanglement</a> is possible. This was rejected by Einstein, who proposed the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPR_paradox\">EPR paradox</a>, but it was subsequently quantified by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_inequalities\">Bells inequalities</a>.<ref><a href=\"http://bendov.info/eng/crucial.htm\">Ben Dov, Y. Local Realism and the Crucial experiment.</a></ref> If Bells inequalities are violated, either local realism <em>or</em> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/counterfactual_definiteness\">counterfactual definiteness</a> must be incorrect; but some physicists dispute that experiments have demonstrated Bell's violations, on the grounds that the sub-class of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bells_Theorem#Two_classes_of_Bell_inequalities\">inhomogeneous Bell inequalities</a> has not been tested or due to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_loopholes\">experimental limitations in the tests</a>. Different <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interpretation_of_quantum_mechanics\">interpretations of quantum mechanics</a> violate different parts of local realism and/or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/counterfactual_definiteness\">counterfactual definiteness</a>.</p>\n<h3>Role of the observer in quantum mechanics</h3>\n<p>The quantum mind–body problem refers to the philosophical discussions of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mind–body_problem\">mind–body problem</a> in the context of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantum_mechanics\">quantum mechanics</a>. Since quantum mechanics involves <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantum_superposition\">quantum superposition</a>s, which <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics\">are not perceived by observers</a>, some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics\">interpretations of quantum mechanics</a> place conscious observers in a special position.</p>\n<p>The founders of quantum mechanics debated the role of the observer, and of them, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli\">Wolfgang Pauli</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg\">Werner Heisenberg</a> believed that it was the observer that produced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wave_function_collapse\">collapse</a>. This point of view, which was never fully endorsed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr\">Niels Bohr</a>, was denounced as mystical and anti-scientific by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein\">Albert Einstein</a>.

The theory of everything is also called the <strong>final theory</strong>. Many candidate theories of everything have been proposed by theoretical physicists during the twentieth century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general_relativity\">general relativity</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quantum_mechanics\">quantum mechanics</a> are hard to unify.

Aristotle developed a comprehensive theory of being, according to which only individual things, called substances, fully have being, but other things such as relations, quantity, time, and place (called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_(Aristotle)\">categories</a>) have a derivative kind of being, dependent on individual things.

Arnauld thought that a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proposition\">proposition</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making\">judgment</a> consists of taking two different ideas and either putting them together or rejecting them:</p>\n<p>This judgment is also called a proposition, and it is easy to see that it must have two terms.  One term, of which one affirms or denies something, is called the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subject_(philosophy)\">subject</a>; the other term, which is affirmed or denied, is called the attribute or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predicate_(logic)\">Praedicatum</a>.|x|x|Antoine Arnauld|<em>The Art of Thinking</em> (<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-Royal_Logic\">Port-Royal Logic</a></em>),(1662) (translated J. Buroker 1996), Logic, II.3, page 82}}</p>\n<p>The two terms are joined by the verb \"is\" (or \"is not\", if the predicate is denied of the subject). Thus every proposition has three components: the two terms, and the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics)\">copula</a>\" that connects or separates them. Even when the proposition has only two words, the three terms are still there. For example \"God loves humanity\", really means \"God is a lover of humanity\", \"God exists\" means \"God is a thing\".</p>\n<p>This theory of judgment dominated logic for centuries, but it has some obvious difficulties: it only considers proposition of the form \"All A are B.\", a form logicians call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universal_quantifier\">universal</a>. It does not allow propositions of the form \"Some A are B\", a form logicians call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/existential_quantifier\">existential</a>. If neither A nor B includes the idea of existence, then \"some A are B\" simply adjoins A to B. Conversely, if A or B do include the idea of existence in the way that \"triangle\" contains the idea \"three angles equal to two right angles\", then \"A exists\" is automatically true, and we have an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ontological_proof\">ontological proof</a> of As existence. (Indeed Arnaulds contemporary <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes\">Descartes</a> famously argued so, regarding the concept \"God\" (discourse 4, Meditation 5)). Arnauld's theory was current until the middle of the nineteenth century.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume\">David Hume</a> argued that the claim that a thing exists, when added to our notion of a thing, does not add anything to the concept. For example, if we form a complete notion of Moses, and superadd to that notion the claim that Moses existed, we are not adding anything to the notion of Moses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant\">Kant</a> also argued that existence is not a \"real\" predicate, but gave no explanation of how this is possible. Indeed, his famous discussion of the subject is merely a restatement of Arnauld's doctrine that in the proposition \"God is omnipotent\", the verb \"is\" signifies the joining or separating of two concepts such as \"God\" and \"omnipotence\".[date=January 2010]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer\">Schopenhauer</a> claimed that “everything that exists for knowledge, and hence the whole of this world, is only object in relation to the subject, perception of the perceiver, in a word, representation.”<ref><em>The World as Will and Representation</em>, vol. I, § 1</ref> According to him there can be \"No object without subject\" because \"everything objective is already conditioned as such in manifold ways by the knowing subject with the forms of its knowing, and presupposes these forms&hellip;\"(ref: ReferenceA)<em>The World as Will and Representation</em>, vol. I, § 7</ref></p>\n<h2>Predicative nature</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill\">John Stuart Mill</a> (and also Kants pupil <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Herbart\">Herbart</a>) argued that the predicative nature of existence was proved by sentences like \"A centaur is a poetic fiction\"<ref><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill\">John Stuart Mill</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_System_of_Logic\">A System of Logic</a><em>, 1843 I. iv. 1.page 124</ref> or \"A greatest number is impossible\" (Herbart).<ref></em>Uberweg (System of Logic) §68</ref> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Brentano\">Franz Brentano</a> challenged this; so also (as is better known) did <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege\">Frege</a>. Brentano argued that we can join the concept represented by a noun phrase \"an A\" to the concept represented by an adjective \"B\" to give the concept represented by the noun phrase \"a B-A\". For example, we can join \"a man\" to \"wise\" to give \"a wise man\". But the noun phrase \"a wise man\" is not a sentence, whereas \"some man is wise\" is a sentence. Hence the copula must do more than merely join or separate concepts. Furthermore, adding \"exists\" to \"a wise man\", to give the complete sentence \"a wise man exists\" has the same effect as joining \"some man\" to \"wise\" using the copula. So the copula has the same effect as \"exists\". Brentano argued that every categorical proposition can be translated into an existential one without change in meaning and that the \"exists\" and \"does not exist\" of the existential proposition take the place of the copula. He showed this by the following examples:</p>\n<p>: The categorical proposition \"Some man is sick\" has the same meaning as the existential proposition \"A sick man exists\" or \"There is a sick man\".</p>\n<p>: The categorical proposition \"No stone is living\" has the same meaning as the existential proposition \"A living stone does not exist\" or \"there is no living stone\".</p>\n<p>: The categorical proposition \"All men are mortal\" has the same meaning as the existential proposition \"An immortal man does not exist\" or \"there is no immortal man\".</p>\n<p>: The categorical proposition \"Some man is not learned\" has the same meaning as the existential proposition \"A non-learned man exists\" or \"there is a non-learned man\".</p>\n<p>Frege developed a similar view (though later) in his great work <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundations_of_Arithmetic\">The Foundations of Arithmetic</a></em>, as did <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce\">Charles Sanders Peirce</a> (but Peirce held that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce#Philosophy:_metaphysics\">the possible and the real are not limited to the actually, individually existent</a>).  The Frege-Brentano view is the basis of the dominant position in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy\">modern Anglo-American philosophy</a>: that existence is asserted by the existential quantifier (as expressed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine\">Quine</a>s slogan \"To be is to be the value of a variable.\" — On What There Is<em>, 1948).<ref></em>On What There Is<strong>– in Review of Metaphysics (1948). Reprinted in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Van_Orman_Quine\">W.V.O. Quine</a>, </strong>From a Logical Point of View (Harvard University Press, 1953)</ref></p>\n<h3>Semantics</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mathematical_logic\">mathematical logic</a>, there are two quantifiers, \"some\" and \"all\", though as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Brentano\">Brentano</a> (1838–1917) pointed out, we can make do with just one quantifier and negation. The first of these quantifiers, \"some\", is also expressed as \"there exists\". Thus, in the sentence \"There exists a man\", the term \"man\" is asserted to be part of existence. But we can also assert, \"There exists a triangle.\" Is a \"triangle\" — an abstract idea — part of existence in the same way that a \"man\" — a physical body — is part of existence? Do abstractions such as goodness, blindness, and virtue exist in the same sense that chairs, tables, and houses exist? What <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_(Aristotle)\">categories</a>, or kinds of thing, can be the subject or the predicate of a proposition?</p>\n<p>Worse, does \"existence\" exist?<ref><em>To exist is to have a specific relation to existence – a relation, by the way, which existence itself does not have</em>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell\">Bertrand Russell</a> – <em>The Principles of Mathematics</em> – New York, W. W. Norton & Company, 1903, second edition 1937 pages 449–450.</ref></p>\n<p>In some statements, existence is implied without being mentioned. The statement \"A bridge crosses the Thames at Hammersmith\" cannot just be about a bridge, the Thames, and Hammersmith. It must be about \"existence\" as well. On the other hand, the statement \"A bridge crosses the Styx at Limbo\" has the same form, but while in the first case we understand a real bridge in the real world made of stone or brick, what \"existence\" would mean in the second case is less clear.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nominalist\">nominalist</a> approach is to argue that certain noun phrases can be \"eliminated\" by rewriting a sentence in a form that has the same meaning, but does not contain the noun phrase. Thus <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_of_Ockham\">Ockham</a> argued that \"Socrates has wisdom\", which apparently asserts the existence of a reference for \"wisdom\", can be rewritten as \"Socrates is wise\", which contains only the referring phrase \"Socrates\".  This method became widely accepted in the twentieth century by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy\">analytic school</a> of philosophy.</p>\n<p>However, this argument may be inverted by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_realism\">realists</a> in arguing that since the sentence \"Socrates is wise\" can be rewritten as \"Socrates has wisdom\", this proves the existence of a hidden referent for \"wise\".</p>\n<p>A further problem is that human beings seem to process information about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)\">fictional characters</a> in much the same way that they process information about real people. For example, in the 2008 United States presidential election, a politician and actor named <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Thompson\">Fred Thompson</a> ran for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)\">Republican Party</a> nomination. In polls, potential voters identified Fred Thompson as a \"law and order\" candidate. Thompson plays a fictional character on the television series <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&_Order_franchise\">Law and Order</a></em>. Doubtless the people who make the comment are aware that <em>Law and Order</em> is fiction, but at some level, they process fiction as if it were fact.[date=August 2009][date=August 2009] Another example of this is the common experience of actresses who play the villain in a soap opera being accosted in public as if they are to blame for the actions of the characters they play.</p>\n<p>A scientist might make a clear distinction about objects that exist, and assert that all objects that exist are made up of either matter or energy. But in the layperson's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/worldview\">worldview</a>, existence includes real, fictional, and even contradictory objects. Thus if we reason from the statement \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus\">Pegasus</a> flies\" to the statement \"Pegasus exists\", we are not asserting that Pegasus is made up of atoms, but rather that Pegasus exists in a particular worldview, the worldview of classical myth. When a mathematician reasons from the statement \"ABC is a triangle\" to the statement \"triangles exist\", she is not asserting that triangles are made up of atoms but rather that triangles exist within a particular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mathematical_model\">mathematical model</a>.</p>\n<h2>Modern approaches</h2>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell\">Bertrand Russell</a>s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Descriptions\">Theory of Descriptions</a>, the negation operator in a singular sentence can take either wide or narrow scope: we distinguish between \"some S is not P\" (where negation takes \"narrow scope\") and \"it is not the case that some S is P\" (where negation takes \"wide scope\"). The problem with this view is that there appears to be no such scope distinction in the case of proper names. The sentences \"Socrates is not bald\" and \"it is not the case that Socrates is bald\" both appear to have the same meaning, and they both appear to assert or presuppose the existence of someone (Socrates) who is not bald, so that negation takes narrow scope. However, Russells theory analyses proper names into a logical structure which makes sense of this problem. According to Russell Socrates can be analysed into the form The Philosopher of Greece. In the wide scope this would then read: It is not the case that there existed a philosopher of Greece who was bald.  In the narrow scope it would read the Philosopher of Greece was not bald. </p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_reference\">direct-reference</a> view, an early version of which was originally proposed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell\">Bertrand Russell</a>, and perhaps earlier by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege\">Gottlob Frege</a>, a proper name strictly has no meaning when there is no object to which it refers. This view relies on the argument that the semantic function of a proper name is to tell us <em>which</em> object bears the name, and thus to identify some object.  But no object can be identified if none exists. Thus, a proper name must have a bearer if it is to be meaningful.</p>\n<h3>Existence in the wide and narrow senses</h3>\n<p>According to the \"two sense\" view of existence, which derives from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexius_Meinong\">Alexius Meinong</a>, existential statements fall into two classes.</p>\n<p># Those asserting existence in a <em>wide</em> sense. These are typically of the form \"N is P\" for singular N, or \"some S is P\".</p>\n<p># Those asserting existence in a <em>narrow</em> sense. These are typically of the form \"N exists\" or \"Ss exist\".</p>\n<p>The problem is then evaded as follows. \"Pegasus flies\" implies existence in the wide sense, for it implies that <em>something</em> flies. But it does not imply existence in the narrow sense, for we deny existence in this sense by saying that Pegasus does not exist. In effect, the world of all things divides, on this view, into those (like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates\">Socrates</a>, the planet <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus\">Venus</a>, and New York City) that have existence in the narrow sense, and those (like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes\">Sherlock Holmes</a>, the goddess <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(mythology)\">Venus</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minas_Tirith\">Minas Tirith</a>) that do not.</p>\n<p>However, common sense suggests the non-existence of such things as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(arts)\">fictional characters</a> or places.</p>\n<h3> European views </h3>\n<p>Influenced by the views of Brentano's pupil <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexius_Meinong\">Alexius Meinong</a>, and by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl\">Edmund Husserl</a>, Germanophone and Francophone philosophy took a different direction regarding the question of existence.</p>\n<h3>Anti-realist arguments</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-realism\">Anti-realism</a> is the view of idealists who are skeptics about the physical world, maintaining either: 1) that nothing exists outside the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mind\">mind</a>, or 2) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality even if it may exist. Realists, in contrast, hold that perceptions or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sense_data\">sense data</a> are caused by mind-independent objects. An \"anti-realist\" who denies that other minds exist (i. e., a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/solipsist\">solipsist</a>) is different from an \"anti-realist\" who claims that there is no fact of the matter as to whether or not there are unobservable other minds (i. e., a logical <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/behaviorist\">behaviorist</a>).</p>\n<h2> Dharmic \"middle way\" view </h2>\n<p>The Indian philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna#Philosophy\">Nagarjuna</a> (c. 150 – 250 CE) largely advanced existence concepts and founded the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhyamaka\">Madhyamaka</a> school of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahāyāna\">Mahāyāna</a> Buddhism.</p>\n<p>In eastern philosophy, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anicca\">Anicca</a> (Sanskrit <em>anitya</em>) or \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/impermanence\">impermanence</a>\" describes existence. It refers to the fact that all conditioned things (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sankhara\">sankhara</a>) are in a constant state of flux. In reality there is no thing that ultimately ceases to exist; only the appearance of a thing ceases as it changes from one form to another. Imagine a leaf that falls to the ground and decomposes. While the appearance and relative existence of the leaf ceases, the components that formed the leaf become particulate material that goes on to form new plants. Buddhism teaches a middle way, avoiding the extreme views of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eternalism_(philosophy_of_time)\">eternalism</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nihilism\">nihilism</a>.<ref><span class=\"reference\" data-type=\"web \" data- url=\"http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/various/wheel186.html \" data- title=\"The Three Basic Facts of Existence \" data-accessdate=\"2009-07-14\" data- last=\"The Buddhist Publication Society \" data- quote=\"(ref.1) Change or impermanence is the essential characteristic of all phenomenal existence. We cannot say of anything, animate or inanimate, organic or inorganic, \"this is lasting\"; for even while we are saying this, it would be undergoing change. All is fleeting; the beauty of flowers, the birds melody, the bees hum, and a sunsets glory.\"></span></ref>  The middle way recognizes there are vast differences between the way things are perceived to exist and the way things really exist. The differences are reconciled in the concept of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunyata\">Shunyata</a> by addressing the existing objects served purpose for the subject's identity in being. What exists is in non-existence, because the subject changes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailokya\">Trailokya</a> elaborates on three kinds of existence, those of desire, form, and formlessness in which there are karmic rebirths. Taken further to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trikaya\">Trikaya</a> doctrine, it describes how the Buddha exists. In this philosophy, it is accepted that the Buddha exists in more than one absolute way.</p>\n<h2> See also </h2>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being\">Being</a></li>\n<li> <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum\">Cogito ergo sum</a></em></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law_(physics)\">Conservation law</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmogony\">Cosmogony</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_argument\">Cosmological argument</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_precedes_essence\">Existence precedes essence</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_theorem\">Existence theorem</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism\">Existentialism</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_operator\">Existential operator</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel's_ontological_proof\">Gödel's ontological proof</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaunilo_of_Marmoutiers\">Gaunilo of Marmoutiers</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_and_change\">Identity and change</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life_(philosophy)\">Meaning of life</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_contradiction\">Performative contradiction</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_exist\">Right to exist</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism\">Solipsism</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence\">Three marks of existence</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_experience\">Personal experience</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2> Notes </h2>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Arnauld\">Antoine Arnauld</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Nicole\">Pierre Nicole</a> <em>Logic, or the Art of Thinking</em>, (known as the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-Royal_Logic\">Port-Royal Logic</a></em>), translated J.

-eld)</em>, a compound of  <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/were\">wer</a></em> \"man\" and <em>eld</em> \"age,\" which thus means roughly \"Age of Man.\"<ref><a href=\"http://.com/61/roots/IE588.html\"><em>American Heritage Dictionary</em> </a></ref></p>\n<p>The Old English is a reflex of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Germanic\">Common Germanic</a> <em>*wira-alđiz</em>, also reflected in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Saxon\">Old Saxon</a> <em>werold</em>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German\">Old High

(whence the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language\">Icelandic</a> <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:en:veröld\">veröld</a></em>).</p>\n<p>The corresponding word in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin\">Latin</a>  is <em>mundus</em>, literally \"clean, elegant\", itself a loan translation of Greek <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cosmos\">cosmos</a></em> \"orderly arrangement.\" While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a \"domain of Man\" (compare <a

In others, it can mean have a specific <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ontology\">ontological</a> sense (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_disclosure\">world disclosure</a>). While clarifying the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concept\">concept</a> of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_philosophy\">Western philosophy</a>, this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century<ref><span class=\"reference\" data-type=\"book \" data-last=\"Heidegger \" data-first=\"Martin \" data-location=\"Bloomington \" data-publisher=\"Indiana University Press \" data-year=\"1982 \" data-page=\"165 \" data-isbn=\"0-253-17686-7 \">Basic Problems of Phenomenology </span>.</ref> and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.</p>\n<p>;Parmenides</p>\n<p>The traditional interpretation of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides\">Parmenides</a><em>work is that he argued that the every-day perception of reality of the physical world (as described in </em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides#The_Way_of_Opinion_(doxa)\">doxa</a><em>) is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is </em>One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.</p>\n<p>;Plato</p>\n<p>In his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave\">Allegory of the Cave</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato\">Plato</a> distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds : the sensible world and the intelligible world.</p>\n<p>;Hegel</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegel\">Hegel</a>s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy_of_history\">philosophy of history</a>, the expression Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.</p>\n<p>;Schopenhauer</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation\">The World as Will and Representation</a></em> is the central work of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer\">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>.</p>\n<p>Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.</p>\n<p>;Wittgenstein</p>\n<p>Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. \"The world is everything that is the case,\" wrote <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein\">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> in his influential <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus\">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a></em>, first published in 1922. This definition would serve as the basis of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logical_positivism\">logical positivism</a>, with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.</p>\n<p>;Heidegger</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger\">Martin Heidegger</a>, meanwhile, argued that \"the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world\". The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already \"thrown\" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_disclosure\">world disclosure</a>\" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Time\">Being and Time</a></em>.</p>\n<p>;Freud</p>\n<p>In response, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud\">Sigmund Freud</a> proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.</p>\n<p>;Other</p>\n<p>Some philosophers, often inspired by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kellogg_Lewis\">David Lewis</a>, argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability and necessity are best analyzed by comparing <em>the</em> world to a range of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/possible_world\">possible world</a>s; a view commonly known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modal_realism\">modal realism</a>.</p>\n<h2>Religion and mythology</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:yggdrasil.jpg\">thumb</a>, a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_tree\">world tree</a> which connects the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/heaven\">heaven</a>s, the world, and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/underworld\">underworld</a>.]]</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythological_cosmology\">Mythological cosmologies</a> often depict the world as centered around an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axis_mundi\">axis mundi</a> and delimited by a boundary such as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus\">world ocean</a>, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jörmungandr\">world serpent</a> or similar.

Therefore the passions of the World are simply called \"the world\". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosis_(Eastern_Orthodox_theology)\">theosis</a>). The process of theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evagrius_Ponticus\">Evagrius Ponticus</a>, and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by Eastern Christians, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philokalia\">Philokalia</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladder_of_Divine_Ascent\">Ladder of Divine Ascent</a> (the works of Evagrius and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Climacus\">John Climacus</a> are also contained within the Philokalia).

Its usage often designates differences between the species as a whole and any other nature or entity.</p>\n<p>In scientific terms, the definition of \"human\" has changed with the discovery and study of the fossil ancestors of modern humans. The previously clear boundary between human and ape blurred, resulting in \"Homo\" referring to \"human\" now encompassing multiple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species\">species</a>.  There is also a distinction between <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anatomically_modern_humans\">anatomically modern humans</a></em> and <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Homo_sapiens\">Archaic Homo sapiens</a></em>, the earliest fossil members of the species, which are classified as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subspecies\">subspecies</a> of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, e.g. <em>Homo sapiens neanderthalensis</em>.</p>\n<p>The English adjective <em>human</em> is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English\">Middle English</a>  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loanword\">loanword</a> from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French\">Old French</a> <em>[frohumain]</em>, ultimately from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin\">Latin</a> <em>[lahūmānus]</em>, the adjective form of <em>[lahomō]</em> \"man\".

The latter use is now obsolete.<ref>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OED\">OED</a> considers obsolete the sense \"a designation applied equally to particular individuals of either sex\", citing a 1597 source as the most recent (\"The Lord had but one paire of men in Paradise.\") while it continues to endorse the sense \"as a general or indefinite designation\" as current in English.</ref> Generic uses of the term \"man\" are declining, in favor of reserving it for referring specifically to adult males.

During the next million years a process of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/encephalization\">encephalization</a> began, and with the arrival of <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus\">Homo erectus</a></em> in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. <em>Homo erectus</em> were the first of the hominina to leave Africa, and these species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe between [1.31.8]. One population of <em>H. erectus</em>, also sometimes classified as a separate species <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_ergaster\">Homo ergaster</a></em>, stayed in Africa and evolved into <em>Homo sapiens</em>. It is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools. The earliest transitional fossils between <em>H. ergaster/erectus</em> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/archaic_humans\">archaic humans</a> are from Africa such as <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_rhodesiensis\">Homo rhodesiensis</a></em>, but seemingly transitional forms are also found at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmanisi\">Dmanisi</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)\">Georgia</a>.

While the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nucleotide_diversity\">nucleotide</a> genetic variation of individuals of the same sex across global populations is no greater than 0.1%, the genetic difference between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man\">males</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/woman\">females</a> is between 1% and 2%. Although different in nature, this approaches the genetic differentiation between men and male chimpanzees or women and female chimpanzees. The genetic difference between sexes contributes to anatomical, hormonal, neural, and physiological differences between men and women, although the exact degree and nature of social and environmental influences on sexes are not completely understood. Males on average are 15% heavier and 15&nbsp;cm taller than females. There is a difference between body types, body organs and systems, hormonal levels, sensory systems, and muscle mass between sexes. There is a difference of about 40–50% in upper body strength and 20–30% in lower body strength between men and women. Women generally have higher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/body_fat\">body fat</a> percentage than men. Women of the same population have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color#sexual_dimorphism\">lighter skin</a> than men; this has been explained by a higher need for vitamin D (which is synthesized by sunlight) in females during <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pregnancy\">pregnancy</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactation\">lactation</a>. As there are chromosomal differences between females and males, some X and Y chromosome related conditions and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease\">disorder</a>s only affect either men or women. Other conditional differences between males and females are not related to  sex chromosomes. Even after controlling for body weight and volume, male <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/voice\">voice</a> is usually an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/octave\">octave</a> deeper than females’.

Motivation is based on emotion—specifically, on the search for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contentment\">satisfaction</a> (positive emotional experiences), and the avoidance of conflict. Positive and negative is defined by the individual brain state, which may be influenced by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_norm\">social norm</a>s: a person may be driven to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-injury\">self-injury</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/violence\">violence</a> because their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain\">brain</a> is conditioned to create a positive response to these actions. Motivation is important because it is involved in the performance of all learned responses. Within <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psychology\">psychology</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/conflict_avoidance\">conflict avoidance</a> and the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libido\">libido</a> are seen to be primary motivators. Within <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/economics\">economics</a>, motivation is often seen to be based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incentive\">incentive</a>s; these may be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/financial\">financial</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moral\">moral</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coercive\">coercive</a>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion\">Religion</a>s generally posit divine or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demon\">demon</a>ic influences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happiness\">Happiness</a>, or the state of being happy, is a human emotional condition. The definition of happiness is a common <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy\">philosophical</a> topic. Some people might define it as the best condition that a human can have—a condition of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mental_health\">mental</a> and physical <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/health\">health</a>. Others define it as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:freedom\">freedom</a> from want and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suffering\">distress</a>; consciousness of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goodness_and_value_theory\">good</a> order of things; assurance of one's place in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/universe\">universe</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/society\">society</a>.</p>\n<p>Emotion has a significant influence on, or can even be said to control, human behavior, though historically many <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/culture\">culture</a>s and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosopher\">philosopher</a>s have for various reasons discouraged allowing this influence to go unchecked. Emotional experiences perceived as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pleasure\">pleasant</a>, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/love\">love</a>, admiration, or joy, contrast with those perceived as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suffering\">unpleasant</a>, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hate\">hate</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/envy\">envy</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sorrow_(emotion)\">sorrow</a>. There is often a distinction made between refined emotions that are socially learned and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:survival\">survival</a> oriented emotions, which are thought to be innate. Human exploration of emotions as separate from other neurological phenomena is worthy of note, particularly in cultures where emotion is considered separate from physiological state. In some cultural medical theories emotion is considered so synonymous with certain forms of physical health that no difference is thought to exist. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism\">Stoics</a> believed excessive emotion was harmful, while some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi\">Sufi</a> teachers felt certain extreme emotions could yield a conceptual perfection, what is often translated as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecstasy_(emotion)\">ecstasy</a>.</p>\n<p>In modern scientific thought, certain refined emotions are considered a complex neural trait innate in a variety of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domesticated_animal\">domesticated</a> and non-domesticated <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammal\">mammal</a>s. These were commonly developed in reaction to superior survival mechanisms and intelligent interaction with each other and the environment; as such, refined emotion is not in all cases as discrete and separate from natural neural function as was once assumed. However, when humans function in civilized tandem, it has been noted that uninhibited acting on extreme emotion can lead to social disorder and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crime\">crime</a>.</p>\n<h3>Sexuality and love</h3>\n<p>For humans, sexuality has important social functions: it creates physical intimacy, bonds and hierarchies among individuals, besides ensuring biological <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reproduction\">reproduction</a>. Humans are one of only two primate species, the other being the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonobo\">bonobo</a>, that frequently have sex outside of female fertile periods and that also often engage in sexual activity for no other purpose than pleasure and enjoyment, something that is very rare among other animals.[date=August 2012] Sexual desire or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/libido\">libido</a>, is experienced as a bodily urge, often accompanied by strong emotions such as love, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecstasy_(emotion)\">ecstasy</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/jealousy\">jealousy</a>. The significance of sexuality in the human species is reflected in a number of physical features among them hidden <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ovulation\">ovulation</a>, the evolution of external <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scrotum\">scrotum</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_penis\">penis</a> suggesting <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sperm\">sperm</a> competition, the absence of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baculum\">os penis</a>, permanent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/secondary_sexual_characteristics\">secondary sexual characteristics</a> and the forming of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pair_bond\">pair bond</a>s based on sexual attraction as a common social structure. Contrary to other primates that often advertise <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/estrus\">estrus</a> through visible signs, human females do not have a distinct or visible signs of ovulation plus they experience sexual desire outside of their fertile periods. These adaptations indicate that the meaning of sexuality in humans is similar to that found in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bonobo\">bonobo</a>, and that the complex human sexual behavior has a long <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolution\">evolution</a>ary history.<ref name=Haviland2010><span class=\"reference\" data-type=\"book \" data-author=\"Haviland, Wiliam A.; Prins, Harald E.L.; McBride, Bunny; Walrath, Dana \" data-year=\"2010 \" data-publisher=\"Wadsworth/Cengage Learning \" data-location=\"Belmont, California \" data-page=\"82 \" data-isbn=\"978-0-495-81082-7 \" data-url=\"http://books.google.com/books?id\">Cultural Anthropology: The Human Challenge </span></ref></p>\n<p>Human choices in acting on sexuality are commonly influenced by cultural norms which vary widely. Restrictions are often determined by religious beliefs or social customs. The pioneering researcher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud\">Sigmund Freud</a> believed that humans are born <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosexual_development\">polymorphously perverse</a>, which means that any number of objects could be a source of pleasure.

More than any other creature,[date=January 2014] humans are adept[date=January 2014] at utilizing systems of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/communication\">communication</a> for self-expression, the exchange of ideas, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_organization\">organization</a>, and as such have created complex <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_structures\">social structures</a> composed of many cooperating and competing groups. Human groups range from families to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nations\">nations</a>. Social interactions between humans have established an extremely wide variety[date=January 2014] of values, social norms, and rituals, which together form the basis of human <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/society\">society</a>.</p>\n<p>Culture is defined here as patterns of complex symbolic behavior, i.e. all behavior that is not innate but which has to be learned through social interaction with others; such as the use of distinctive <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/material_culture\">material</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symbolic_system\">symbolic system</a>s, including language, ritual, social organization, traditions, beliefs and technology.</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>While many species <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/animal_communication\">communicate</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language\">language</a> is unique to humans, a defining feature of humanity, and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cultural_universal\">cultural universal</a>. Unlike the limited systems of other animals, human language is open&nbsp;– an infinite number of meanings can be produced by combining a limited number of symbols. Human language also has the capacity of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(linguistics)\">displacement</a>, using words to represent things and happenings that are not presently or locally occurring, but reside in the shared imagination of interlocutors.(ref: Revolution)<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_speech#Modality-independence\">modality independent</a>; the same meanings can be conveyed through different media, auditively in speech, visually by sign language or writing, and even through tactile media such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/braille\">braille</a>.</p>\n<p>Language is central to the communication between humans, and to the sense of identity that unites nations, cultures and ethnic groups. The invention of writing systems at least five thousand years ago allowed the preservation of language on material objects, and was a major technological advancement. The science of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/linguistics\">linguistics</a> describes the structure and function of language and the relationship between languages. There are approximately six thousand different languages currently in use, including <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sign_language\">sign language</a>s, and many thousands more that are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extinct_language\">extinct</a>.<ref name=Comrie1996><span class=\"reference\" data-type=\"book \" data-author=\"Comrie, Bernard; Polinsky, Maria; Matthews, Stephen \" data-year=\"1996 \" data-publisher=\"Facts on File \" data-location=\"New York, New York \" data-pages=\"13–15 \" data-isbn=\"978-0-8160-3388-1\">The Atlas of Languages: The Origin and Development of Languages Throughout the World </span></ref></p>\n<h3>Gender roles</h3>\n<p>The sexual division of humans into male and female has been marked culturally by a corresponding division of roles, norms, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/practice_(social_theory)\">practices</a>, dress, behavior, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rights\">rights</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duty\">duties</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(social_inequality)\">privilege</a>s, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_status\">status</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/power_(philosophy)\">power</a>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_identity\">Cultural differences</a> by gender have often been believed to have arisen naturally out of a division of reproductive labor; the biological fact that women give birth led to their further cultural responsibility for nurturing and caring for children. Gender roles have varied historically, and challenges to predominant gender norms have recurred in many societies.</p>\n<h3>Kinship</h3>\n<p>All human societies organize, recognize and classify types of social relationships based on relations between parents and children (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/consanguinity\">consanguinity</a>), and relations through marriage (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(law)\">affinity</a>). These kinds of relations are generally called kinship relations. In most societies kinship places mutual responsibilities and expectations of solidarity on the individuals that are so related, and those who recognize each other as kinsmen come to form networks through which other social institutions can be regulated. Among the many functions of kinship is the ability to form <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/descent_group\">descent group</a>s, groups of people sharing a common line of descent, which can function as political units such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clan\">clan</a>s. Another function is the way in which kinship unites families through marriage, forming <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_theory\">kinship alliances</a> between groups of wife-takers and wife-givers. Such alliances also often have important political and economical ramifications, and may result in the formation of political organization above the community level. Kinship relations often includes regulations for whom an individual should or shouldn't marry. All societies have rules of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incest_taboo\">incest taboo</a>, according to which marriage between certain kinds of kin relations are prohibited&nbsp;– such rules vary widely between cultures. Some societies also have rules of preferential marriage with certain kin relations, frequently with either <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_and_cross_cousins\">cross or parallel cousins</a>. Rules and norms for marriage and social behavior among kinsfolk is often reflected in the systems of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kinship_terminology\">kinship terminology</a> in the various languages of the world. In many societies kinship relations can also be formed through forms of co-habitation, adoption, fostering, or companionship, which also tends to create relations of enduring solidarity.</p>\n<h3>Ethnicity</h3>\n<p>Humans often form ethnic groups, such groups tend to be larger than kinship networks and be organized around a common identity defined variously in terms of shared ancestry and history, shared cultural norms and language, or shared biological phenotype. Such ideologies of shared characteristics are often perpetuated in the form of powerful, compelling narratives that give legitimacy and continuity to the set of shared values.  Ethnic groupings often correspond to some level of political organization such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_society\">band</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tribe\">tribe</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/city_state\">city state</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation\">nation</a>. Although ethnic groups appear and disappear through history, members of ethnic groups often conceptualize their groups as having histories going back into the deep past. Such ideologies give ethnicity a powerful role in defining <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_identity\">social identity</a> and in constructing solidarity between members of an ethno-political unit.  This unifying property of ethnicity has been closely tied to the rise of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nation_state\">nation state</a> as the predominant form of political organization in the 19th and 20th century.<ref>J.

A state is an organized political community occupying a definite territory, having an organized government, and possessing internal and external <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereignty\">sovereignty</a>. Recognition of the states claim to independence by other states, enabling it to enter into international agreements, is often important to the establishment of its statehood. The \"state\" can also be defined in terms of domestic conditions, specifically, as conceptualized by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber\">Max Weber</a>, \"a state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate<em>use of physical force within a given territory.\"<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20020612070242/http://www.mdx.ac.uk/www/study/xWeb.htm Max Weber</em>s definition of the modern state 1918, by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber\">Max Weber</a>, 1918.

Politics is the process by which decisions are made within groups; this process often involves conflict as well as compromise. Although the term is generally applied to behavior within governments, politics is also observed in all human group interactions, including corporate, academic, and religious institutions. Many different political systems exist, as do many different ways of understanding them, and many definitions overlap. Examples of governments include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monarchy\">monarchy</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state\">Communist state</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_dictatorship\">military dictatorship</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/theocracy\">theocracy</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liberal_democracy\">liberal democracy</a>, the last of which is considered dominant today. All of these issues have a direct relationship with economics.</p>\n<h3>Trade and economics</h3>\n<p>Trade is the voluntary exchange of goods and services, and is a form of economics. A mechanism that allows trade is called a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/market\">market</a>. The original form of trade was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/barter_(economics)\">barter</a>, the direct exchange of goods and services. Modern traders instead generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/earnings\">earning</a>. The invention of money (and later <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_(finance)\">credit</a>, paper money and non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade. Because of specialization and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/division_of_labor\">division of labor</a>, most people concentrate on a small aspect of manufacturing or service, trading their labor for products. Trade exists between regions because different regions have an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_advantage\">absolute</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/comparative_advantage\">comparative advantage</a> in the production of some tradable commodity, or because different regions' size allows for the benefits of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mass_production\">mass production</a>.</p>\n<p>Economics is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_science\">social science</a> which studies the production, distribution, trade, and consumption of goods and services. Economics focuses on measurable variables, and is broadly divided into two main branches: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/microeconomics\">microeconomics</a>, which deals with individual agents, such as households and businesses, and macroeconomics, which considers the economy as a whole, in which case it considers <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aggregate_supply\">aggregate supply</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aggregate_demand\">demand</a> for money, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_(economics)\">capital</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/commodity\">commodities</a>. Aspects receiving particular attention in economics are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/resource_allocation\">resource allocation</a>, production, distribution, trade, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/competition\">competition</a>. Economic logic is increasingly applied to any problem that involves choice under scarcity or determining economic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)\">value</a>.</p>\n<h3>War</h3>\n<p>War is a state of organized armed conflict between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)\">states</a> or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-state_actors\">non-state actors</a>. War is characterized by the use of lethal <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/violence\">violence</a> between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/combatants\">combatants</a> and/or upon <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-combatants\">non-combatants</a> to achieve military goals through force. Lesser, often spontaneous conflicts, such as brawls, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/riots\">riots</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/revolts\">revolts</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/melees\">melees</a>, are not considered to be warfare. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution\">Revolution</a>s can be <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_revolution\">nonviolent</a> or an organized and armed revolution which denotes a state of war. During the 20th century, it is estimated that between 167 and 188 million people died as a result of war. A common definition defines war as a series of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/military_campaign\">military campaign</a>s between at least two opposing sides involving a dispute over <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sovereignty\">sovereignty</a>, territory, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/natural_resource\">resources</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/religion\">religion</a>, or other issues.

It is the discipline searching for a general understanding of reality, reasoning and values. Major fields of philosophy include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logic\">logic</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaphysics\">metaphysics</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epistemology\">epistemology</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/philosophy_of_mind\">philosophy of mind</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/axiology\">axiology</a> (which includes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethics\">ethics</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aesthetics\">aesthetics</a>). Philosophy covers a very wide range of approaches, and is used to refer to a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/worldview\">worldview</a>, to a perspective on an issue, or to the positions argued for by a particular philosopher or school of philosophy.</p>\n<h3>Science and mathematics</h3>\n<p>Another unique aspect of human culture and thought is the development of complex methods for acquiring knowledge through observation and quantification. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_method\">scientific method</a> has been developed to acquire knowledge of the physical world and the rules, processes and principles of which it consists, and combined with mathematics it enables the prediction of complex patterns of causality and consequence. Some other animals are able to recognize differences in small quantities, [date=October 2013] but humans are able to understand and recognize much larger, even abstract, quantities, and to recognize and understand algorithmic patterns which enables infinite <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/counting\">counting</a> routines and algebra, something that is not found in any other species.</p>\n<h3>Art, music, and literature</h3>\n<p>Music is a natural <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_(knowledge)\">intuitive</a> phenomenon based on the three distinct and interrelated organization structures of rhythm, harmony, and melody. Listening to music is perhaps the most common and universal form of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/entertainment\">entertainment</a>, while learning and understanding it are popular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/discipline\">discipline</a>s.[date=June 2013] There are a wide variety of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/music_genre\">music genre</a>s and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ethnic_music\">ethnic music</a>s. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature\">Literature</a>, the body of written—and possibly oral—works, especially creative ones, includes prose, poetry and drama, both fiction and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/non-fiction\">non-fiction</a>.

Early representations of \"branching\" phylogenetic trees include a \"paleontological chart\" showing the geological relationships among plants and animals in the book <em>Elementary Geology</em>, by Edward Hitchcock (first edition: 1840).</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin\">Charles Darwin</a> (1859) also produced one of the first illustrations and crucially popularized the notion of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection\">evolutionary \"tree\"</a> in his seminal book <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Species\">The Origin of Species</a></em>. Over a century later, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_biology\">evolutionary biologist</a>s still use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure\">tree diagram</a>s to depict <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolution\">evolution</a> because such diagrams effectively convey the concept that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speciation\">speciation</a> occurs through the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation\">adaptive</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/random\">random</a> splitting of lineages. Over time, species classification has become less static and more dynamic.</p>\n<h2>Types</h2>\n<h3>Rooted tree</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Neomuratree.svg\">thumb</a>, based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalier-Smith\">Cavalier-Smith</a>'s theory of bacterial evolution. (Cf. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_universal_ancestor\">LUCA</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neomura\">Neomura</a>.)]]</p>\n<p>A rooted phylogenetic tree is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directed_graph\">directed</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tree_(data_structure)\">tree</a> with a unique node corresponding to the (usually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/imputation_(statistics)\">imputed</a>) most recent common ancestor of all the entities at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leaf_node\">leaves</a> of the tree. The most common method for rooting trees is the use of an uncontroversial <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/outgroup_(cladistics)\">outgroup</a>—close enough to allow inference from sequence or trait data, but far enough to be a clear outgroup.</p>\n<h3>Unrooted tree</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:MyosinUnrootedTree.jpg\">thumb</a></p>\n<p>Unrooted trees illustrate the relatedness of the leaf nodes without making assumptions about ancestry at all. While unrooted trees can always be generated from rooted ones by simply omitting the root, a root cannot be inferred from an unrooted tree without some means of identifying ancestry; this is normally done by including an outgroup in the input data or introducing additional assumptions about the relative rates of evolution on each branch, such as an application of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molecular_clock\">molecular clock</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hypothesis\">hypothesis</a>.

A rooted bifurcating tree has exactly two descendants arising from each <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/interior_node\">interior node</a> (that is, it forms a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binary_tree\">binary tree</a>), and an unrooted bifurcating tree takes the form of an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unrooted_binary_tree\">unrooted binary tree</a>, a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free_tree\">free tree</a> with exactly three neighbors at each internal node. In contrast, a rooted multifurcating tree may have more than two children at some nodes and an unrooted multifurcating tree may have more than three neighbors at some nodes. A labeled tree has specific values assigned to its leaves, while an unlabeled tree, sometimes called a tree shape, defines a topology only. The number of possible trees for a given number of leaf nodes depends on the specific type of tree, but there are always more multifurcating than bifurcating trees, more labeled than unlabeled trees, and more rooted than unrooted trees. The last distinction is the most biologically relevant; it arises because there are many places on an unrooted tree to put the root. For labeled bifurcating trees, there are:</p>\n<p>:<math></p>\n<p>(2n-3)!! = \\frac{(2n-3)!}{2^{n-2}(n-2)!} \\,,\\,\\text{for}\\,n \\ge 2</p>\n<p>total rooted trees and</p>\n<p>:<math></p>\n<p>(2n-5)!! = \\frac{(2n-5)!}{2^{n-3}(n-3)!} \\,,\\,\\text{for}\\,n \\ge 3</p>\n<p>total unrooted trees, where <math>n</math> represents the number of leaf nodes. Among labeled bifurcating trees, the number of unrooted trees with <math>n</math> leaves is equal to the number of rooted trees with <math>n-1</math> leaves.(ref: Felsenstein)<em>Inferring Phylogenies</em> Sinauer Associates: Sunderland, MA.</ref></p>\n<h3>Special tree types</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Tree_of_life_SVG.svg\">thumb</a>, based on completely sequenced genomes.<ref><span class=\"reference\" data-type=\"journal \" data-last=\"Letunic \" data-first=\"I \" data-year=\"2007 \" data-journal=\"Bioinformatics \" data-volume=\"23 \" data-pages=\"127–8 \" data-format=\"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubmed\">Pubmed</a> \" data-pmid=\"17050570 \" data-last2=\"Bork \" data-first2=\"P \" data-issue=\"1 \" data-doi=\"10.1093/bioinformatics/btl529\">Interactive Tree Of Life (iTOL): an online tool for phylogenetic tree display and annotation. </span></ref><ref><span class=\"reference\" data-type=\"journal \" data- last =\" Ciccarelli\" data-first=\"FD\" data-year=\"2006\" data-journal=\"Science\" data-volume=\"311\" data-pages=\"1283–7\" data-format=\"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubmed\">Pubmed</a>\" data-doi=\"10.1126/science.1123061\" data-pmid=\"16513982\" data-last2=\"Doerks\" data-first2=\"T\" data-last3=\"Von Mering\" data-first3=\"C\" data-last4=\"Creevey\" data-first4=\"CJ\" data-last5=\"Snel\" data-first5=\"B\" data-last6=\"Bork\" data-first6=\"P\" data-issue=\"5765\" data-bibcode=\"2006Sci...311.1283C\">Toward automatic reconstruction of a highly resolved tree of life</span></ref>]]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dendrogram\">dendrogram</a> is a broad term for the diagrammatic representation of a phylogenetic tree.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cladogram\">cladogram</a> is a phylogenetic tree formed using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cladistics\">cladistic</a> methods.

For this reason, serious phylogenetic studies generally use a combination of genes that come from different genomic sources (e.g., from mitochondrial or plastid vs. nuclear genomes), or genes that would be expected to evolve under different selective regimes, so that homoplasy (false <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homology_(biology)\">homology</a>) would be unlikely to result from natural selection.</p>\n<p>When extinct species are included in a tree, they are <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leaf_node\">terminal node</a>s, as it is unlikely that they are direct ancestors of any extant species.

He proved the relation via an argument relying on trees.  See:  Kirchhoff, G. R.

An <strong>internal vertex</strong> is a vertex of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)\">degree</a> at least 2.</p>\n<p>An <strong>irreducible</strong> (or <em>series-reduced</em>) tree is a tree in which there is no vertex of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)\">degree</a> 2.</p>\n<p>A <strong>forest</strong> is an undirected graph, all of whose <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/connected_component_(graph_theory)\">connected component</a>s are trees; in other words, the graph consists of a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/disjoint_union\">disjoint union</a> of trees. Equivalently, a forest is an undirected cycle-free graph. As special cases, an empty graph, a single tree, and the discrete graph on a set of vertices (that is, the graph with these vertices that has no edges), all are examples of forests.</p>\n<p>The term <strong>hedge</strong> sometimes refers to an ordered sequence of trees.</p>\n<p>A <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polytree\">polytree</a></strong>(ref: d99) (also known as <strong>oriented tree</strong>(ref: s91) or <strong>singly connected network</strong>(ref: kp83)) is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directed_acyclic_graph\">directed acyclic graph</a> (DAG) whose underlying undirected graph is a tree. In other words, if we replace its arcs with edges, we obtain an undirected graph that is both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)\">connected</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)\">acyclic</a>.</p>\n<p>A <strong>directed tree</strong> is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directed_graph\">directed graph</a> which would be a tree if the directions on the edges were ignored.  Some authors restrict the phrase to the case where the edges are all directed towards a particular vertex, or all directed away from a particular vertex (see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arborescence_(graph_theory)\">arborescence</a>).</p>\n<p>A tree is called a <strong>rooted tree</strong> if one vertex has been designated the <strong>root</strong>, in which case the edges have a natural orientation, <em>towards</em> or <em>away</em> from the root. The <em>tree-order</em> is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partial_ordering\">partial ordering</a> on the vertices of a tree with <em>u</em> ≤ <em>v</em> if and only if the unique path from the root to <em>v</em> passes through <em>u</em>. A rooted tree which is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#Subgraphs\">subgraph</a> of some graph <em>G</em> is a <strong>normal tree</strong> if the ends of every edge in <em>G</em> are comparable in this tree-order whenever those ends are vertices of the tree [Diestel2005p=15]. Rooted trees, often with additional structure such as ordering of the neighbors at each vertex, are a key data structure in computer science; see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tree_data_structure\">tree data structure</a>. In a context where trees are supposed to have a root, a tree without any designated root is called a <strong>free tree</strong>.</p>\n<p>In a rooted tree, the <strong>parent</strong> of a vertex is the vertex connected to it on the path to the root; every vertex except the root has a unique parent.  A <strong>child</strong> of a vertex <em>v</em> is a vertex of which <em>v</em> is the parent.</p>\n<p>A <strong>labeled tree</strong> is a tree in which each vertex is given a unique label.  The vertices of a labeled tree on <em>n</em> vertices are typically given the labels 1, 2, …, <em>n</em>. A <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/recursive_tree\">recursive tree</a></strong> is a labeled rooted tree where the vertex labels respect the tree order (<em>i.e.</em>, if <em>u</em> < <em>v</em> for two vertices <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>, then the label of <em>u</em> is smaller than the label of <em>v</em>).</p>\n<p>An <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/k-ary_tree\">n-ary tree</a></strong> is a rooted tree for which each vertex has at most <em>n</em> children. <em>2-ary trees</em> are sometimes called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binary_tree\">binary tree</a>s, while <em>3-ary trees</em> are sometimes called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ternary_tree\">ternary tree</a>s.</p>\n<p>A <strong>terminal vertex</strong> of a tree is a vertex of degree 1. In a rooted tree, the leaves are all terminal vertices; additionally, the root, if not a leaf itself, is a terminal vertex if it has precisely one child.</p>\n<h3> Plane tree </h3>\n<p>An <strong>[ordered tree]</strong> or <strong>plane tree</strong> is a rooted tree for which an ordering is specified for the children of each vertex. This is called a \"plane tree\" because an ordering of the children is equivalent to an embedding of the tree in the plane,  with the root at the top and the children of each vertex lower than that vertex. Given an embedding of a rooted tree in the plane, if one fixes a direction of children, say left to right, then an embedding gives an ordering of the children. Conversely, given an ordered tree, and conventionally drawing the root at the top, then the child nodes in an ordered tree can be drawn left-to-right, yielding an essentially unique planar embedding .</p>\n<p>A <strong>leaf</strong> in a rooted tree is a vertex of degree 1 that is not the root.  A <strong>terminal vertex</strong> of a tree is a vertex of degree 1. In a rooted tree, the leaves are all terminal vertices; additionally, the root, if not a leaf itself, is a terminal vertex if it has precisely one child.</p>\n<h2> Example </h2>\n<p>The example tree shown to the right has 6 vertices and 6 &minus; 1 = 5 edges. The unique simple path connecting the vertices 2 and 6 is 2-4-5-6.</p>\n<h2> Facts </h2>\n<ul>\n<li> Every tree is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bipartite_graph\">bipartite graph</a> and a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/median_graph\">median graph</a>.

In other words, a star graph of order <em>n</em> is a tree of order <em>n</em> with as many leaves as possible.  Its diameter is at most 2.</p>\n<p>A tree with two leaves (the fewest possible) is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/path_graph\">path graph</a>; a forest in which all components are isolated nodes and path graphs is called a <strong>linear forest</strong>. If all vertices in a tree are within distance one of a central path subgraph, then the tree is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caterpillar_tree\">caterpillar tree</a>.

																			"text": "<p>In <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graph_theory\">graph theory</a>, a <strong>path</strong> in a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graph_(mathematics)\">graph</a> is a finite or infinite <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sequence\">sequence</a> of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/edge_(graph_theory)\">edges</a> which connect a sequence of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vertex_(graph_theory)\">vertices</a> which, by most definitions, are all distinct from one another.  In a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/directed_graph\">directed graph</a>, a directed path is again a sequence of edges (or arcs) which connect a sequence of vertices, but with the added restriction that the edges all be directed in the same direction.</p>\n<p>Paths are fundamental concepts of graph theory, described in the introductory sections of most graph theory texts. See e.g. Bondy and Murty (1976), Gibbons (1985), or Diestel (2005). Korte et al. (1990) cover more advanced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/algorithmic\">algorithmic</a> topics concerning paths in graphs.</p>\n<h2> Definitions </h2>\n<p>A path of length <math>k</math> in a graph is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges, <math>v_0,e_0,v_1,e_1,v_2,\\ldots, v_{k-1},e_{k-1},v_k</math>, which begins and ends with vertices.   If the graph is directed, then <math>e_i</math> is an arc from <math>v_i</math> to <math>v_{i+1}</math>.  An infinite path is an alternating sequence of the same type described here, but with no first or last vertex, and a semi-infinite path (also <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/end_(graph_theory)\">ray</a>) has a first vertex, <math>v_0</math>, but no last vertex.  Most authors require that all of the edges and vertices be distinct from one another.  </p>\n<p>A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weighted_graph\">weighted graph</a> associates a value (<em>weight</em>) with every edge in the graph. The <em>weight of a path</em> in a weighted graph is the sum of the weights of the traversed edges. Sometimes the words <em>cost</em> or <em>length</em> are used instead of weight.</p>\n<h2> Examples </h2>\n<ul>\n<li> A graph is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)\">connected</a> if there are paths containing each pair of vertices.</li>\n<li> A directed graph is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly-connected_digraph\">strongly connected</a> if there are oppositely oriented directed paths containing each pair of vertices.</li>\n<li> A path such that no graph edges connect two nonconsecutive path vertices is called an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/induced_path\">induced path</a>.</li>\n<li> A path that includes every vertex of the graph is known as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path\">Hamiltonian path</a>.</li>\n<li> Two paths are <em>vertex-independent</em> (alternatively, <em>internally vertex-disjoint</em>) if they do not have any internal vertex in common. Similarly, two paths are <em>edge-independent</em> (or <em>edge-disjoint</em>) if they do not have any internal edge in common.  Two internally vertex-disjoint paths are edge-disjoint, but the converse is not necessarily true.</li>\n<li> The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance_(graph_theory)\">distance</a> between two vertices in a graph is the length of a shortest path between them, if one exists, and otherwise the distance is infinity.</li>\n<li> The diameter of a connected graph is the largest distance (defined above) between pairs of vertices of the graph.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Several algorithms exist to find <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem\">shortest</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_path_problem\">longest</a> paths in graphs, with the important distinction that the former problem is computationally much easier than the latter, unless <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P=NP\">P=NP</a>.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm\">Dijkstra's algorithm</a> produces a list of shortest paths from a source vertex to every other vertex in directed and undirected graphs with non-negative edge weights (or no edge weights), whilst the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman–Ford_algorithm\">Bellman–Ford algorithm</a> can be applied to directed graphs with negative edge weights.  The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm\">Floyd–Warshall_algorithm</a> can be used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in weighted directed graphs.</p>\n<h2> See also </h2>\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory\">Glossary of graph theory</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_graph\">Path graph</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem\">Shortest path problem</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_path_problem\">Longest path problem</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm\">Dijkstra%27s_algorithm</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman–Ford_algorithm\">Bellman–Ford algorithm</a> </li>\n<li> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd–Warshall_algorithm\">Floyd–Warshall_algorithm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2> References </h2>\n<p> | url=http://www.ecp6.jussieu.fr/pageperso/bondy/books/gtwa/gtwa.html}}</p>\n<p> | pages = 6–9}}</p>\n<p> | isbn = 0-521-28881-9}}</p>\n<p> | isbn = 0-387-52685-4}}</p>\n<p><span class=\"category\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_theory_objects\">Graph theory objects</a></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"category\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Graph_connectivity\">Graph connectivity</a></span></p>\n",
